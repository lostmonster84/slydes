# AIDA Framework

> **User Psychology Framework**
> Understanding where people come from and what they need at each stage.

## What is AIDA?

**A**ttention → **I**nterest → **D**esire → **A**ction

AIDA is **not** a marketing framework. It's a **user psychology framework** for understanding:
- **Who** arrives at your product
- **Why** they're there
- **What** they're feeling
- **What** they need at each stage

This applies to everything - pages, features, onboarding, support, product design. Anywhere humans interact with what you build.

## The AIDA Stages

### A - ATTENTION
*"What made them notice? What are they escaping?"*

**Purpose:** Understand the moment of arrival

**Questions to ask:**
- Where did they come from?
- What problem brought them here?
- What are they tired of?
- What caught their eye?
- What's their emotional state on arrival?

**For Slydes:**
- Coming from: Frustration with slow, desktop-first websites
- Problem: Mobile sites that don't convert
- Tired of: Website builders that aren't mobile-native
- Emotional state: Skeptical but curious

**What users need at this stage:**
- Immediate clarity on what this is
- Signals that this is different
- Permission to explore without commitment
- Confidence they're in the right place

### I - INTEREST
*"What makes them stay? What questions do they have?"*

**Purpose:** Understand what keeps them engaged

**Questions to ask:**
- What do they need to understand next?
- What objections are forming?
- What would build credibility?
- What makes this relevant to them?
- What pain points need addressing?

**For Slydes:**
- Need to understand: How vertical scroll works, what's included
- Objections forming: "Is this just another builder?"
- Credibility builders: Real examples, live demos
- Relevance: Their industry represented
- Pain points: Mobile conversion rates, maintenance hassle

**What users need at this stage:**
- Answers to unspoken questions
- Proof this solves their problem
- Evidence of expertise
- Clear benefits (not just features)

### D - DESIRE
*"What makes them want it? What's the emotional hook?"*

**Purpose:** Understand the emotional decision

**Questions to ask:**
- What would make them feel this is for them?
- What social proof matters?
- What aspiration does this fulfil?
- What fear does this calm?
- What would make them imagine success?

**For Slydes:**
- Feel it's for them: Seeing their industry in the showcase
- Social proof: Real businesses, real results
- Aspiration: Being ahead of competition, looking modern
- Fear calmed: Not being left behind, mobile users bouncing
- Imagine success: Interactive phone mockups they can scroll

**What users need at this stage:**
- To see themselves succeeding
- Proof others have succeeded
- Emotional connection to the outcome
- Risk reduction (guarantees, transparency)

### A - ACTION
*"What do they need to take the next step?"*

**Purpose:** Understand the decision moment

**Questions to ask:**
- What's stopping them from acting?
- What would reduce friction?
- What options suit different readiness levels?
- What trust signals matter here?
- What's the smallest possible commitment?

**For Slydes:**
- Stopping them: Price concerns, commitment fear, uncertainty
- Reduce friction: Clear pricing, simple process, no lock-in
- Different readiness: Waitlist (low), demo (medium), buy (high)
- Trust signals: Transparent pricing, real contact info
- Smallest commitment: Join waitlist (just email)

**What users need at this stage:**
- Clear, low-friction next step
- Options for different commitment levels
- Trust signals nearby
- Confidence in the process

### Onboarding
- **Attention**: First impression - does it feel right?
- **Interest**: Learning curve - is it engaging?
- **Desire**: Early wins - do they want more?
- **Action**: Next step - is it obvious?

### Support

- **Interest**: Understanding the issue - do we get it?
- **Desire**: Confidence in resolution - do they trust us?
- **Action**: Resolution path - is it clear?

### Product Development

## The Core Truth

AIDA is not about manipulation or conversion tricks.

It's about **understanding humans**:
- Where they come from
- What they're feeling
- What they need
- How to serve them at each stage

Any product, page, feature, or interaction can be improved by asking:
- Do we understand who arrives? (Attention)
- Do we answer their questions? (Interest)
- Do we meet their emotional needs? (Desire)
- Do we make the next step easy? (Action)

---

## Summary

**AIDA = User Psychology Framework**

Use AIDA to:
- Understand who arrives and why
- Know what users need at each stage
- Design experiences that meet people where they are
- Measure how well you understand your users

**Key Philosophy:**
*"AIDA is not about getting users to convert. It's about understanding what people need and serving them at each stage of their journey."*
