## FEATURE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

### How We Decide What to Build

**Criteria**:
1. **Impact**: Does this 10x value for users?
2. **Effort**: Can we ship it in <1 month?
3. **Alignment**: Does it move us toward network effect?
4. **Differentiation**: Does this make us unique?

**Prioritization Matrix**:
- **High Impact + Low Effort** = Ship NOW
- **High Impact + High Effort** = Plan for next quarter
- **Low Impact + Low Effort** = Nice-to-have (backlog)
- **Low Impact + High Effort** = Don't build
