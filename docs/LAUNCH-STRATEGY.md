## 🔥 The Narrative

### What We're Selling

**Not**: "A website builder"  
**But**: "The future of mobile business presence"

**Not**: "Mobile optimization tool"  
**But**: "TikTok for businesses"

**Not**: "Easy content management"  
**But**: "Kill your boring website"

### The Enemy

**We're fighting against**:
- Desktop-first web design (2005 thinking)
- Static, boring websites
- Text-heavy pages nobody reads
- Agencies charging $10k for mobile sites
- Businesses losing customers to bad UX

**We're the rebels**. We're the future. We're Slydes.

## 📣 Launch Messaging

### Pre-Launch Teaser (Week -2)

**LinkedIn Post**:
```
Old school websites are dead.

They were built for desktop.
Your customers are on mobile.

Static images?
They want video.

Text-heavy pages?
They want stories.

The future is vertical.
The future is immersive.
The future is mobile-first.

The future is Slydes.

Coming January 2026.

Who's ready? 🚀
```

**Twitter Thread**:
```
1/ Your website has a problem.

(And it's costing you customers.)

2/ 80% of your traffic is mobile.
But your site was built for desktop.

3/ They land. They wait. They leave.
Every day, you're losing people who would've bought.

4/ The solution isn't "responsive design."
That's 2015 thinking.

5/ The solution is building FOR mobile.
Not adapting TO mobile.

6/ Enter: Slydes.

TikTok-style vertical scrolling.
Video-first storytelling.
Immersive, not informational.

7/ Restaurants show sizzling steaks.
Hotels show room tours.
Tours show adventure footage.

All on mobile. All immersive.

8/ We're launching in January.

100 spots for early access.

HEADLINE:
Slydes Launches to Kill Desktop-First Websites, Bring TikTok Experience to Business Mobile Sites

SUBHEAD:
New platform enables restaurants, hotels, and tour operators to create immersive, video-driven mobile experiences in minutes—no developer required.

EDINBURGH, UK - January 15, 2026 - Slydes, a mobile-first web platform, today announced its public launch, offering businesses a way to replace static, desktop-oriented websites with TikTok-style vertical scrolling experiences optimized for mobile.

"80% of web traffic is mobile, but most business websites were built for desktop in 2005 and never really adapted," said James McKay, founder of Slydes. "We're not talking about 'mobile responsive.' We're talking about building FOR mobile from day one. That's what Slydes does."

The platform targets hospitality and experience-based businesses—restaurants, hotels, vacation rentals, tour operators—where visual storytelling drives bookings. Instead of text-heavy pages and image galleries, Slydes enables full-screen video backgrounds, swipeable content frames, and mobile-native interactions.

Early adopters report significant improvements:
• 200% increase in mobile engagement
• 3.6 hours saved per site in design time
• 99.99% accuracy between editor preview and mobile reality

Slydes offers three tiers: Starter ($49/mo), Professional ($149/mo), and Enterprise ($499/mo). All plans include a 14-day free trial with no credit card required.
