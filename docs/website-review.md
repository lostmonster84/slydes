# 4. Slydes.io Website Review

## Purpose
This document captures a strategic scan of the current website with conversion and positioning in mind.

---

## What's Working

- Core insight is clear and compelling
- Demo-led explanation works well
- Swipe mechanics are explained clearly
- Real-world credibility via WildTrax

---

## Key Issues

### Affiliate Programme Visibility

Affiliate messaging is too prominent and splits intent.

#### Risks
- Reduces trust for B2B buyers
- Frames Slydes as something to promote, not adopt

#### Recommendations
- Remove affiliate blocks from homepage
- Keep affiliates in footer only
- Remove commission numbers and urgency language
- Rename to neutral "Partner Programme"

---

### Availability Messaging

Mixed signals between "available now" and "launching soon".

#### Recommendation
Choose one clear state and repeat consistently.

---

### Industry Positioning

"Built for any industry" appears too early.

#### Recommendation
Lead with one wedge (e.g. car hire or hospitality), then broaden.

---

### Metrics Credibility

Strong stats lack light validation.

#### Recommendation
Add subtle footnotes or a short "how we measure" link.

---

## Structural Improvements

- Remove affiliate links from investor-facing pages
- Ensure consistent www / non-www redirects
- Keep homepage focused on adoption, not promotion

---

## Strategic Summary

The product is strong.
The risk is dilution through mixed signals.

Slydes should present itself as:
The mobile destination layer for modern attention.

Anything that distracts from that narrative should be hidden, deferred, or reframed.
