## Strategic Analysis: Vertical Video Discovery for Automotive Sales

> **"Could a Slydes-style platform disrupt AutoTrader, CarGurus, and the £5B automotive marketplace industry?"**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Question**: Can vertical video storytelling transform how people discover and buy cars?

**The Answer**: **Yes, but only for specific segments.** The opportunity is segmented:

1. **Luxury/Exotic/Classic Cars** (✅ STRONG) - Experience-driven, discovery-minded buyers
2. **Lifestyle Vehicles** (✅ VIABLE) - Campervans, off-roaders, sports cars
3. **Mass Market** (❌ NOT VIABLE) - Spec-driven, filter-first, commodity purchases

**Verdict**: AutoSlyde could be a **£30-50M ARR business** focused on luxury/enthusiast vehicles, NOT an AutoTrader killer.

## 1. CURRENT STATE OF CAR BUYING

### How the Incumbents Work

| Platform | Model | Revenue | UX Pattern |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| **AutoTrader UK** | Listing aggregator | £400M+/year | Filter → Grid → Gallery |
| **AutoTrader US** | Lead generation | $2B+/year | Filter → Grid → Dealer contact |
| **CarGurus** | Marketplace | $800M/year | Deal ratings + listings |
| **Cars.com** | Lead generation | $600M/year | Similar grid + dealer ads |

### The Standard User Flow

```
1. Set filters (make, model, year, price, mileage)
2. View grid of vehicles (hero photo + price + specs)
3. Click through to 20-40 static photos
4. Check vehicle history (HPI, Carfax)
5. Contact dealer or submit inquiry form
6. Get bombarded with calls/emails
```

**This flow is SPEC-FIRST, not DISCOVERY-FIRST.**

### Revenue Model (AutoTrader UK Example)

- Dealers pay **£500-2,000/month** for listings
- Featured listings cost **extra per vehicle**
- Private sellers pay **£10-50 per listing**
- Premium placements drive higher visibility
- Lead generation fees for dealer inquiries

### Pain Points

**For Buyers:**
- **Photo fatigue**: 30 photos of similar angles, all looking the same
- **Information overload**: Thousands of "2019 BMW 3 Series" listings
- **Trust gap**: "Is this car as good as it looks?" (hidden damage, issues)
- **Dealer spam**: Submit one inquiry, get 10 calls within an hour
- **No emotional connection**: Specs don't tell you how it FEELS
- **Discovery problem**: Hard to find "the one" when filter-first

**For Dealers:**
- **Commoditization**: Every car looks identical in photos
- **Price race to bottom**: Buyers sort by price, ignore everything else
- **Low differentiation**: Premium listings don't feel premium
- **High lead costs**: £50-150 per qualified lead
- **No personal brand**: Dealer personality is invisible

**For Private Sellers:**
- Properties blur together in the sea of listings
- Hard to stand out (AutoTrader prioritizes dealers)
- Selling experience is transactional, not storytelling

## 2. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR VISUAL STORYTELLING

### Would Vertical Video Add Value?

| Segment | Value Proposition | Fit for AutoSlyde? |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Luxury/Exotic** (£50k+) | Emotional purchase, lifestyle sell | ✅ STRONG FIT |
| **Classic/Collector** | Provenance, condition, story matters | ✅ STRONG FIT |
| **Lifestyle vehicles** | Campervans, off-roaders, sports cars | ✅ STRONG FIT |
| **Modified/Custom** | Unique builds, enthusiast appeal | ✅ STRONG FIT |
| **Standard used cars** | Commodity, spec-driven | ❌ WEAK FIT |
| **Budget buyers** (£5-15k) | Price is everything, just need transport | ❌ WEAK FIT |

### Why Vertical Video COULD Work

1. **Doug DeMuro effect**: Car video content gets MILLIONS of views
2. **Emotional connection**: Video shows personality, sound, driving experience
3. **Trust building**: See the car from every angle, hear the engine, spot issues
4. **Discovery browsing**: "What exotic car speaks to me?" (not "filter to top 3")
5. **Shareability**: "Look at this Ferrari!" - viral potential for standout vehicles
6. **Dealer branding**: Boutique dealers become content creators

### Why Vertical Video Might NOT Work

1. **High-stakes purchase**: Cars are £10k-200k+, people need data and due diligence
2. **Spec-driven decisions**: MPG, mileage, service history matter more than vibes
3. **Video production barrier**: Dealers are busy, quality video takes effort
4. **Mass market is commodity**: A 2018 VW Golf = 2018 VW Golf (no story to tell)

### What Exists Today

| Platform/Trend | What It Is | Success? |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Bring a Trailer** | Auction + detailed photos/video | ✅ $400M+ annual sales |
| **Cars & Bids** | Doug DeMuro's auction site | ✅ Growing fast |
| **Vroom/Carvana** | 360° spins (automated) | ⚠️ Functional, not storytelling |
| **YouTube car channels** | Doug DeMuro, Carwow, etc. | ✅ 4M+ subscribers each |
| **TikTok dealers** | Viral walkarounds | ✅ High engagement, no marketplace |
| **AutoTrader video** | Optional feature | ⚠️ Exists but buried, low adoption |

**Key Insight**: Video CONTENT performs incredibly well (Doug DeMuro gets 10M+ views). But video LISTINGS don't exist as a primary discovery mechanism yet.

## 3. MARKET ANALYSIS

### TAM/SAM/SOM

| Market | Size | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **US used car market** | 40M vehicles/year | $1 trillion+ market |
| **UK used car market** | 7M vehicles/year | £100B+ market |
| **AutoTrader US revenue** | $2B/year | Lead gen + listings |
| **AutoTrader UK revenue** | £400M/year | Near-monopoly in UK |
| **CarGurus revenue** | $800M/year | Publicly traded (CARG) |

### The Luxury/Enthusiast Segment (Sweet Spot)

| Segment | UK Volume | US Volume | Avg Price |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Luxury (£50k+)** | 200,000/year | 2M/year | £70k |
| **Exotic/Supercar** | 5,000/year | 50,000/year | £150k+ |
| **Classic/Collector** | 50,000/year | 500,000/year | £40k |
| **Modified/Custom** | 100,000/year | 1M/year | £30k |
| **Lifestyle (campervans, etc.)** | 50,000/year | 500,000/year | £50k |

**Combined UK enthusiast market**: ~400,000 vehicles/year
**Combined US enthusiast market**: ~4M vehicles/year

### Revenue Model Comparison

| Model | Revenue Potential | Difficulty |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| **Dealer subscriptions** | £100-300/mo × 5,000 dealers = £6-18M ARR | MEDIUM |
| **Featured listings** | £50-200/vehicle × 50,000/year = £2.5-10M ARR | MEDIUM |
| **Commission on sales** | 1-2% × £200M sales = £2-4M ARR | HARD (tracking) |
| **Full platform replacement** | N/A | IMPOSSIBLE |

---

## 4. DISRUPTION POTENTIAL: REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

### Can AutoSlyde Replace AutoTrader?

**NO. Here's why:**

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Network effects** | AutoTrader has millions of listings. Buyers go where cars are. |
| **Dealer lock-in** | Dealers pay £1k+/month because that's where buyers search |
| **SEO dominance** | "Used cars near me" = AutoTrader owns page 1 |
| **Brand trust** | 20+ years of recognition |
| **Investment** | Would need £100M+ to compete on marketing |

**Competing head-on with AutoTrader = suicide mission.**

### But There's a Gap...

**Bring a Trailer proves the model:**
- $400M+ in annual sales (2023)
- Photo/video-heavy listings
- Community-driven (comments, enthusiasts)
- Premium prices because of better presentation
- **They proved**: Quality storytelling = higher sale prices

**The gap**: No one has made **vertical video** the primary discovery mechanism for enthusiast cars.

## 5. THE THREE PLAYS

### PLAY 1: Luxury/Exotic Discovery Platform (✅ STRONGEST OPPORTUNITY)

**The Insight**: TikTok-style browsing for dream cars.

**How It Works**:
- Consumer-facing app: Swipe through exotic, luxury, classic cars
- Location + price filters, but discovery-first UX
- Video walkarounds, engine sounds, driving footage
- CTA: "Inquire" or "Book viewing"
- Revenue: Dealer subscriptions + featured listings

**Example Experience**:
```
User opens AutoSlyde app
→ Swipes through vertical videos of:
   - Ferrari 488 in London (£180k)
   - Restored E-Type Jag in Edinburgh (£90k)
   - Modified Nissan GTR in Manchester (£65k)
→ Saves favorites, shares with friends
→ Taps "Inquire" on the Ferrari
→ Dealer gets qualified lead
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Luxury buyers browse aspirationally ("What speaks to me?")
- ✅ Video shows what photos can't (sound, presence, condition)
- ✅ Discovery fits the mindset (not filter-first)
- ✅ Bring a Trailer proves premium presentation = premium prices
- ✅ Younger luxury buyers (30-45) live on mobile

**Revenue Model**:

| Tier | Price | Vehicles | Target |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Free** | £0 | 1 listing | Trial dealers |
| **Creator** | £100/mo | 10 vehicles | Boutique specialists |
| **Pro** | £250/mo | 50 vehicles | Mid-size dealers |
| **Enterprise** | £500/mo | Unlimited | Large luxury dealers |

**TAM for Luxury Discovery**:
- **UK**: 2,000 luxury/exotic dealers × £150/mo = £3.6M ARR
- **US**: 20,000 luxury dealers × $200/mo = $48M ARR
- **Realistic capture (10%)**: £400K UK + $5M US = **£4.5M ARR Year 1**

---

### PLAY 2: Dealer Branding Platform (✅ VIABLE)

**The Insight**: AutoSlyde isn't for car search - it's for **DEALER BRANDING**.

**How It Works**:
- Boutique dealers create a personal Slyde showcasing their inventory + expertise
- Sections: Current Stock, Recently Sold, About Us, Testimonials
- URL: `autoslyde.io/prestige-motors`
- Use case: Dealer sends link to prospects, uses in marketing

**Example AutoSlyde for a Dealer**:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Home** | Dealership intro video, showroom tour |
| **Current Stock** | 10-20 vehicles with vertical walkarounds |
| **Recently Sold** | Social proof (happy customers, quality cars) |
| **Why Us** | What makes this dealer different |
| **Testimonials** | Customer review videos |

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Boutique dealers NEED to differentiate from AutoTrader noise
- ✅ Personal branding matters in high-value sales
- ✅ Doesn't compete with AutoTrader (dealers use BOTH)
- ✅ Low barrier to entry (one dealer can start)
- ✅ Video showcases expertise and quality

**TAM for Dealer Branding**:
- **UK**: 5,000 enthusiast dealers × £75/mo = £4.5M ARR potential
- **US**: 50,000 enthusiast dealers × $100/mo = $60M ARR potential
- **Realistic capture (5%)**: £225K UK + $3M US = **£2.5M ARR Year 1**

---

### PLAY 3: Mass Market Video Platform (❌ NOT VIABLE)

**The Insight**: Trying to video-fy all car listings is the wrong approach.

**Why It Won't Work**:
- ❌ Mass market is commodity (2018 VW Golf = 2018 VW Golf)
- ❌ Buyers filter by specs, not vibes
- ❌ High-volume dealers won't produce videos for every car
- ❌ Video adds friction for quick purchase decisions
- ❌ AutoTrader network effects are unbeatable

**Verdict**: Don't even try for mass market.

## 6. SEGMENTATION DEEP DIVE

### Where Video Discovery WORKS

| Segment | Why It Works | Content Example |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Exotic/Supercar** | Emotional purchase, dream fulfillment | Engine start, exhaust note, 0-60 |
| **Classic/Collector** | Provenance, restoration story | History, before/after, details |
| **Modified/Custom** | Unique builds, personal expression | Build story, mods explained |
| **Campervans** | Lifestyle sell, adventure vibes | Interior tour, adventure footage |
| **Off-roaders** | Capability showcase | Trail footage, articulation |
| **Sports cars** | Driving experience | Backroad footage, handling |

### Where Video Discovery DOESN'T Work

| Segment | Why It Fails | What Buyers Actually Want |
|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Commuter cars** | Just need A-to-B transport | Price, MPG, reliability |
| **Budget buyers** | Every £500 matters | Cheapest option that runs |
| **Fleet purchases** | Business decision, not emotional | Specs, bulk pricing |
| **First-time buyers** | Need guidance, not discovery | Affordability, insurance group |

---

## 7. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Focus | Strength | Weakness |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Bring a Trailer** | Auctions (enthusiast) | Community, premium prices | Auction-only, not buy-now |
| **Cars & Bids** | Auctions (enthusiast) | Doug DeMuro audience | Smaller scale, auction-only |
| **Hemmings** | Classics | Established brand | Dated UX, not mobile-first |
| **duPont Registry** | Ultra-luxury | Premium positioning | Static, not video-first |
| **James Edition** | Ultra-luxury (cars, jets, yachts) | High-end audience | Not video-native |

### The Gap AutoSlyde Fills

| Feature | BaT | AutoTrader | AutoSlyde |
|---------|-----|------------|-----------|
| **Video-first** | Partial | Optional | ✅ Core |
| **Mobile-native** | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ |
| **Vertical format** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Buy-now option** | ❌ (auction) | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Discovery UX** | ⚠️ | ❌ (filter-first) | ✅ |
| **Enthusiast focus** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 10. THE VERDICT

### Is AutoSlyde a Real Opportunity?

**YES - But only for enthusiast vehicles, NOT mass market.**

| Opportunity | Viability | TAM | Recommendation |
|-------------|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **Luxury Discovery Platform** | ✅ HIGH | £50M+ ARR | PURSUE |
| **Dealer Branding Platform** | ✅ MEDIUM | £20M ARR | PURSUE |
| **Mass Market Video Platform** | ❌ LOW | N/A | AVOID |

### Key Success Factors

1. **Niche down hard** - Luxury/enthusiast ONLY, no mass market
2. **Video quality matters** - Bad walkarounds = worse than photos
3. **Community building** - Enthusiast engagement drives adoption
4. **Don't compete with AutoTrader** - Be complementary
5. **Prove ROI** - Dealers need to see leads/sales from AutoSlyde

### Comparison to PropertySlyde

| Factor | PropertySlyde | AutoSlyde |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Strongest play** | Agent branding | Luxury discovery |
| **TAM** | £75M+ | £50M+ |
| **Easier to start** | Yes (agents = B2B SaaS) | Medium (consumer app needed) |
| **Competition** | Lower | Higher (BaT, Cars & Bids) |
| **Recommendation** | Stronger opportunity | Viable but more competitive |

---

## 11. CONCLUSION

**AutoSlyde is a legitimate £50M ARR opportunity** - but only for enthusiast vehicles.

**What it IS**:
- A discovery platform for luxury, exotic, classic, and lifestyle vehicles
- A branding platform for boutique dealers
- A complement to AutoTrader (not replacement)

**What it is NOT**:
- An AutoTrader replacement
- A mass-market car search platform
- A solution for commodity vehicles

**The play**: Help enthusiasts discover dream cars, help boutique dealers stand out.

**Should Slydes pursue this?**
- Not now. Focus on core experience-based businesses first.
- Revisit when Slydes is at £5M+ ARR and looking to expand.
- If pursued, consider it a vertical within Slydes (dealers as visual businesses).
- OR spin out as dedicated product if opportunity proves large enough.
