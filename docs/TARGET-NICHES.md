# Slydes – Target Niches (Go-To-Market)

This document defines the **priority niches** for Slydes at launch and beyond.
The goal is focus, speed, and revenue first – not breadth.

---

## Tier 1: Core Launch Niches (Primary Focus)

These niches offer the strongest MVP fit and clearest commercial return.

---

### 1. Property & Real Estate
**Best overall MVP fit**

Includes:
- Estate agents
- Property developers
- New build sites
- Luxury homes
- Overseas property sales

Why this works:
- Heavy video usage
- Mobile-first browsing behaviour
- Clear calls to action (enquire, book viewing)
- Producers already involved in the workflow

Slydes replaces:
- PDF brochures
- Clunky property websites
- Vimeo links
- Static listings

---

### 2. Hospitality & Short Stay
**Second strongest fit**

Includes:
- Lodges
- Hotels
- Holiday lets
- Resorts
- Glamping sites

Why this works:
- Experience-led selling
- Video already standard
- Mobile bookings dominate
- Easy replacement for outdated websites and PDFs

---

### 3. Automotive & Vehicle Hire
**High emotional and visual impact**

Includes:
- Car dealerships
- Luxury or performance vehicles
- Vehicle hire companies
- Campervan and motorhome hire

Why this works:
- Motion matters
- High-ticket items
- Clear enquiries or bookings
- Video is underused but highly persuasive

---

## Tier 2: Adjacent Commercial Niches (Expansion)

These niches become viable once core traction is proven.

---

### 4. Property Services
**Natural extension of property**

Includes:
- Architects
- Interior designers
- Construction firms
- Developers
- Property marketing agencies

Why this works:
- Portfolio-led businesses
- Visual storytelling matters
- Trust and credibility are critical

---

### 5. Experience-Based Businesses
**Selective use cases only**

Includes:
- Gyms and fitness studios
- Adventure experiences
- Retreats
- Spas

Why this works:
- Emotion and atmosphere sell
- Short attention spans
- Mobile-first discovery

Avoid businesses where video does not materially affect conversion.

---

### 6. Events & Venues
**Time-bound, video-heavy use cases**

Includes:
- Wedding venues
- Event spaces
- Festivals
- Corporate venues

Why this works:
- Visual proof is critical
- Clients browse on mobile
- Slydes replaces brochures and galleries

---

## Tier 3: Creative Beneficiaries (Not Primary Targets)

These users benefit because businesses use Slydes.
They are not the initial payers.

---

### 7. Video Producers & Studios
Why include them:
- Credit loop
- Discovery through client Slydes
- Network effects

Producers should onboard organically via credited work.

---

### 8. Photographers
Includes:
- Property photographers
- Automotive photographers
- Hospitality photographers

Same dynamic as video producers.

---

## Tier 4: Later Expansion (Not Launch)

These are intentionally deferred.

---

### 9. Artists & Musicians
Why not now:
- Lower urgency
- More complex rights considerations
- Weaker MVP signal

Strong v2 or v3 opportunity.

---

### 10. General Creators & Influencers
Why avoid early:
- High noise
- Lower willingness to pay
- Harder to position clearly

---

## The Golden Rule

If a niche:
- Uses video
- Shares links
- Wants enquiries or bookings

**Slydes is the answer.**
