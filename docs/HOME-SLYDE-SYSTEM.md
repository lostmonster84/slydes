## What Problem the Home Slyde Solves

Slydes is a link-first, mobile-first format.

People will paste links when intent is:
- broad ("check these guys out")
- exploratory ("what do they offer?")
- social ("you should see this")

Without a Home Slyde, these links have no natural destination.

The Home Slyde solves:
**"Where does attention start when intent is unclear?"**

---

## Core Definition

The Home Slyde is:
> A single-slide, mobile-first decision surface that routes attention into deeper Slydes.

It is not:
- a homepage
- a story
- a scroll experience
- a mini website
- an immersive Slyde

It exists solely to orient and direct.

---

## Core Product Belief

**Phones are for decisions, not scrolling.**

The Home Slyde embodies this belief.

---

## Structural Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Every brand has:
- exactly **one Home Slyde**
- consisting of **exactly one slide**

No exceptions in v1.

---

## Mental Model

Think of Slydes as a system, not a collection of pages.

- Home Slyde = front door (one slide, one decision)
- Child Slydes = rooms (immersive experiences)
- Links decide where you enter the flow

You can:
- enter through the front door
- or deep-link directly into a room

Once inside, everything feels like the same experience.

## How Links Work

### Brand-level link
`slydes.io/wildtrax`

Opens the **Home Slyde** (decision point)

Used for:
- bio links
- generic shares
- recommendations
- "our site" links
- QR codes with broad intent

---

### Deep links
`slydes.io/wildtrax/camping`
`slydes.io/wildtrax/just-drive`

Opens directly into the relevant Child Slyde

Used for:
- ads
- campaigns
- specific offers
- targeted messages

Users can still navigate sideways or back into the wider flow.

---

## Why the Home Slyde Is Mandatory

Every brand must have exactly **one Home Slyde**.

This constraint:
- creates clarity
- prevents fragmentation
- gives the system a root
- makes analytics meaningful

Optional Home Slydes create confusion.
One root creates flow.

---

## How This Changes the Product

With a Home Slyde:
- Slydes become a connected flow
- Links feel intentional
- The dashboard manages flows, not fragments
- Analytics can show entry paths and exits

Without it:
- Slydes feel isolated
- Links feel arbitrary
- The product feels unfinished

---

## One-Line Rule

**The Home Slyde is a decision, not an experience.**

Once a decision is made, immersion happens elsewhere.
