# Founder Memo
## Slydes

This memo exists to protect focus.

When pressure comes from users, partners, investors, or even our own curiosity, this is the document we return to.

If a decision contradicts this memo, the decision is wrong.

## Why Slydes Exists

Mobile behaviour has changed.
The web has not.

People do not browse on phones.
They swipe, glance, and decide.

Yet businesses are still sending mobile traffic to pages designed for scrolling, menus, and reading. The result is friction, bounce, and lost intent.

Slydes exists to fix that.

---

## What Slydes Is

Slydes is not a website builder.

Slydes is a **mobile attention format for the open web**.

It turns swipe behaviour, already native to billions of people, into fast, owned, high-conversion destinations that live outside social platforms.

Slydes finishes attention.
It does not compete for it.

---

## What Slydes Is Not

Slydes is not:
- a CMS
- a page system
- a full website
- a social network
- a marketing automation tool
- an app builder

Trying to become any of these would destroy what makes Slydes valuable.

Constraint is not a limitation.
It is the moat.

---

## The Real Competition

Slydes does not compete with website builders.

It competes with:
- Instagram Stories
- TikTok profiles
- app onboarding flows
- product carousels
- link-in-bio tools

These tools control attention but do not offer ownership.

Slydes offers both.

---

## Our Advantage

Slydes is built around behaviour, not features.

Swipe is not a UI choice.
It is a mental model.

By meeting users where their behaviour already is, Slydes removes friction instead of adding novelty.

This is a format shift, not a tooling improvement.

---

## What We Optimise For

We do not optimise for:
- page views
- time on site
- feature count

We optimise for:
- swipe depth
- completion rate
- actions taken
- speed to value

Attention quality beats attention volume.

---

## How We Build

We build:
- mobile-first
- opinionated flows
- fast creation paths
- momentum-based experiences
- conversion surfaces, not pages

We guide users toward success with guardrails, not flexibility.

If everything is possible, nothing converts.

---

## Where Slydes Lives

Slydes is the destination layer.

It sits at the end of:
- QR codes
- bio links
- SMS links
- ad clicks
- direct shares

Anywhere attention starts, Slydes is where it should finish.

---

## What We Will Never Trade Away

We will never trade:
- speed for features
- clarity for flexibility
- focus for breadth
- momentum for customisation

Saying no is a product decision.

---

## The Long-Term Vision

Slydes should become the default way businesses handle mobile attention.

Not by being everywhere.
But by being obvious.

If someone asks:
"Where should this link go on mobile?"

The answer should be:
"A Slyde."

---

## The Test

Before building, shipping, or changing anything, ask:

Does this:
- make Slydes faster?
- make attention flow more naturally?
- make action more likely?

If not, we do not do it.

---

## Final Truth

Slydes does not win by doing more.

It wins by doing less, better, and in the right order.

This memo is the standard.

When in doubt, return here.
