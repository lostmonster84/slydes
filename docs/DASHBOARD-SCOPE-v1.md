# Slydes – Dashboard Scope (v1)

> Superseded by `DASHBOARD-SCOPE-v1.3.md` (Momentum-first).

Purpose:
The dashboard exists to answer one question:
**“Which Slyde should I improve next, and why?”**

If a component does not directly support that decision,
it does not belong on the dashboard.

---

## Primary Job of the Dashboard

The dashboard is a **decision surface**, not:
- a reporting tool
- a task manager
- a CRM
- an analytics deep dive

It should help creators act quickly and confidently.

---

## What the Dashboard Shows (v1)

### 1. Overall Status (Single Line)

At the top of the page, show one clear state:

Examples:
- “Your Slydes are performing well.”
- “One Slyde needs attention.”
- “Fixing one drop-off could improve results.”

Purpose:
Instant orientation. No interpretation required.

---

### 2. Primary Recommendation (One Only)

Show **one** actionable recommendation at a time.

Example:
- “Fix drop-off on *Camping* at Frame 3 (42% leave here).”

Action:
- Open Slyde

Rules:
- No severity labels
- No multiple cards
- No dismiss buttons

This is the most important action right now.

---

### 3. Slydes List (Ranked by Impact)

Display all live Slydes, ranked by priority.

Each Slyde shows only:
- Name
- Completion rate
- CTA clicks
- Biggest drop-off frame
- Open Slyde action

Purpose:
Help creators choose what to work on next without analysis.

---

### 4. One Behaviour Insight (Optional)

Show **one** supporting insight, if relevant.

Example:
- “QR traffic completes 2.4× more often than bio links.”

Rules:
- One sentence
- No charts
- No historical comparisons

---

## What the Dashboard Does NOT Show

The following do not belong on the main dashboard:

- Inbox or enquiries
- Detailed analytics charts
- Multiple recommendations at once
- Severity labels (High / Medium / Quick win)
- Dismiss actions
- Plan or billing status
- Long tables with many columns
- Vanity metrics (impressions, time on page, totals without context)

These belong elsewhere or later.

---

## Where Other Things Live

- **Editor:** detailed drop-off maps, per-frame analytics
- **Analytics page:** deeper analytics and comparisons
- **Inbox:** enquiries and messages
- **Settings:** plan, billing, brand

The dashboard points to problems.  
Other surfaces explain them.

---

## Data the Dashboard Uses

Only behaviour metrics that drive action:
- Starts
- Completion rate
- CTA clicks
- Biggest drop-off point
- Traffic source quality (summarised)

No metrics without a clear next step.

---

## Design Rules

- One primary action per screen
- Minimal text
- No cognitive branching
- Readable in under 5 seconds
- Works equally well on desktop and mobile

---

## v1.2 Addendum — Quick Actions Row (Allowed)

The dashboard may include a **Quick actions** row at the top, as long as it remains decision-first.

Rules:
- **Max 3** quick actions
- **One** is visually primary (the only true “recommendation”)
- The other 1–2 are **secondary quick wins** (e.g. publish/share), not analytics deep dives
- No severity labels, no dismiss buttons, no extra branching

---

## One-Line Rule

If a creator cannot decide what to do next within five seconds,
the dashboard is doing too much.
