# Culture Memo
## How We Work at Slydes

This memo defines how we think, decide, and build.

Skills can be taught.
Judgement cannot.

If this memo feels uncomfortable, Slydes is not the right place.

---

## We Build for Behaviour, Not Preference

We do not build features because users ask.
We build them because behaviour demands it.

Opinions are cheap.
Behaviour is truth.

When in doubt:
- watch what users do
- ignore what they say
- follow the data

---

## Speed Is a Product Value

Speed is not a deadline.
It is a mindset.

We value:
- fast decisions
- fast experiments
- fast shipping
- fast learning

Perfect is a liability.
Momentum compounds.

---

## Constraint Is a Feature

We believe:
- fewer options lead to better outcomes
- guardrails outperform flexibility
- clarity beats cleverness

If a feature adds freedom but removes direction, we do not ship it.

---

## We Optimise for Momentum

We care about:
- flows, not screens
- movement, not pages
- completion, not presence

Anything that causes hesitation, friction, or pause is a bug.

---

## We Say No More Than We Say Yes

"No" is not negativity.
"No" is focus.

Every "yes" costs us speed and clarity somewhere else.

We protect the core by refusing distractions.

---

## We Are Opinionated and Accountable

We do not hide behind:
- "users might want"
- "competitors have"
- "just in case"

If we ship something, we own the decision.

Strong opinions, loosely held.
Weak opinions, not shipped.

---

## We Build for the Open Web

We do not trap attention.
We do not rent distribution.
We do not chase platforms.

We believe:
- links matter
- ownership matters
- openness wins long-term

---

## We Measure What Matters

We do not celebrate:
- vanity metrics
- inflated dashboards
- surface-level growth

We care about:
- swipe depth
- completion rate
- actions taken
- time to value

If it does not reflect real behaviour, it does not matter.

---

## Simple Beats Clever

Clever impresses teams.
Simple converts users.

If a feature needs explanation, it needs work.

---

## We Default to Trust and Ownership

We hire people we trust.
We give them ownership.
We expect judgement.

Process exists to support decisions, not replace them.

---

## We Respect Focus

Meetings are expensive.
Distraction is theft.

We protect:
- deep work
- clear thinking
- uninterrupted momentum

---

## What Success Looks Like Internally

Success is:
- shipping something small that works
- removing something unnecessary
- making a flow faster
- making a decision clearer

Growth is a byproduct, not the goal.

---

## The Standard

Everything we do should make Slydes:
- faster
- clearer
- more natural to use

If it does not, we stop and rethink.

---

## Final Note

Slydes is not built by consensus.
It is built by clarity.

If you are here, it is because you care about:
- behaviour over noise
- momentum over polish
- ownership over platforms

This memo is not aspirational.
It is operational.

Live by it.
