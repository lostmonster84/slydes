## 🔥 The Energy

### What Makes This Different

**Not another SaaS**:
- We're not "improving" websites
- We're KILLING desktop-first design
- We're bringing TikTok to businesses

**Not playing it safe**:
- Bold positioning ("Old school is OUT")
- Confident voice (no hedging)
- Unapologetic attitude

**Not waiting for perfect**:
- Launch at 90%, iterate to 100%
- Speed beats perfection
- Customer feedback drives product

---

### The Mission

**We're not building a product.**

**We're building a movement.**

Desktop-first web design is DEAD.
Static, boring websites are DEAD.
Text-heavy pages nobody reads are DEAD.

The future is:
- Mobile-native (not adapted)
- Video-first (not text)
- Immersive (not informational)

**The future is Slydes.**

And we're just getting started.
