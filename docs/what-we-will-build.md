# 2. Slydes – What We Will Build

## Purpose
This document defines what Slydes exists to compound.
Every shipped feature must strengthen at least one of these principles.

---

## What We Will Build

### 1. Mobile attention first
Every decision starts with one question:

Does this help capture, hold, or convert mobile attention?

Thumb-first.
Zero friction.
No cognitive load.

---

### 2. Opinionated formats
We build flows, not tools.

- Pre-shaped experiences
- Intent-driven templates
- Clear start and clear finish

Users should decide, not design.

---

### 3. Speed as a product principle
Speed is not technical polish.
It is the product.

We optimise for:
- time to first Slyde
- time to first swipe
- time to first action

Anything that slows these is debt.

---

### 4. Momentum-based experiences
Slydes should feel like movement.

We build:
- narrative sequencing
- swipe cues
- natural next steps

If a user pauses, we failed.

---

### 5. Conversion surfaces
Every Slyde exists to:
- inform
- convince
- convert

A Slyde without purpose is a bug.

---

### 6. Clear destinations
Slydes is where attention finishes.

We support:
- QR codes
- bio links
- SMS links
- ad destinations
- direct shares

We do not compete for attention.
We complete it.

---

### 7. Composability
We integrate rather than imitate.

- forms
- payments
- CRMs
- analytics

We are a layer, not a stack.

---

### 8. Behaviour-based measurement
We prioritise:
- swipe depth
- completion rate
- actions taken
- drop-off points

We ignore vanity metrics.

---

### 9. Guardrails for success
We guide users toward:
- fewer slides
- clearer flows
- stronger actions

If everything is allowed, nothing converts.

---

### One-Paragraph Summary

We build mobile-first, swipe-based attention formats that move users forward quickly and convert intent into action. We prioritise speed, momentum, and clarity over flexibility. Slydes exists to finish attention, not compete for it.
