# Slydes
### Mobile-first video experiences that convert

Slydes turns video into a fullscreen-feeling, tap-through experience built for phones.

No clunky websites.
No dead links.
No distractions.

Just stories that move people to act.

---

## What Slydes is for (launch focus)

Slydes is built for **businesses that rely on video** to sell, showcase, or explain what they do.

At launch, Slydes focuses on a small number of high-impact niches where:
- Video already exists
- Mobile viewing is dominant
- There is a clear commercial outcome

Creators and producers benefit alongside these businesses.

---

## What Slydes is (and isn't)

### Not a website
Websites are slow, cluttered, and designed for desktops.

Slydes is:
- Mobile-first
- Fullscreen-feeling
- Tap-based
- Designed for short attention spans

---

### Not a link-in-bio
Link pages send people away.

Slydes keeps viewers **inside the story**, guiding them from interest to action.

---

### Not just video hosting
Slydes lets you:
- Control the narrative
- Add context to video
- Sequence information intentionally
- End with a clear call to action

---

## How Slydes works

1. Upload your video
2. Build a tap-through Slyde
3. Add a clear call to action
4. Share one simple link

That's it.

---

## Designed for conversion

Every Slyde is built around **action**.

Use Slydes to:
- Drive enquiries
- Book viewings
- Promote launches
- Showcase spaces, vehicles, or experiences
- Replace PDFs and static brochures

One link.
One experience.
One outcome.

---

## Credits that follow the work

Slydes supports **professional accreditation**.

If your video was:
- Produced by a studio
- Filmed by a creator

You can credit them directly on the Slyde.

### How credits work
- Shown directly on the Slyde (subtle overlay)
- Tappable
- Opens the producer's profile Slyde
- Optional approval by the producer

Credits are contextual, visible, and professional.

Because good work deserves recognition.

---

## Mobile-first by design

Slydes is built as a **link-first mobile web experience**.

### About fullscreen
- Mobile browsers cannot be forced into true fullscreen
- Slydes is designed for *perceived fullscreen*
- Browser chrome collapses naturally on interaction

For repeat users and creators:
- Slydes supports "Add to Home Screen"
- This enables true fullscreen, app-like behaviour
- No App Store download required

Viewers never need an app.

---

## Not an app (yet)

Slydes behaves like an app before it becomes one.

- No forced downloads
- No friction for viewers
- Built for sharing

A native app may come later for **creators**, not viewers.

---

## Where Slydes works best

Share Slydes via:
- WhatsApp
- Email
- QR codes
- Instagram bio
- SMS
- Sales decks

Anywhere a link can live.
