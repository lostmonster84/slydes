# Slydes Launch Plan
### Focused, niche-led, revenue-first

---

## Launch philosophy

Slydes does not launch as a "platform".
It launches as a **solution to a specific, painful problem**.

The goal of launch is not press.
The goal is:
- Real users
- Real use
- Real feedback
- Real conversions

Everything below is designed to validate:
- Demand
- Retention
- Willingness to pay

---

## Phase 0: Pre-launch foundations (Week 0)

### Objectives
- Message clarity
- Demo credibility
- Zero friction onboarding

---

### 1. Lock the ICPs
Primary ICPs:
- Property owners and estate agents
- Hospitality operators
- Automotive dealerships and hire firms

Secondary ICP:
- Video producers who already work with the above

You are not selling to "everyone".
You are selling to people who already use video to make money.

---

### 2. Prepare demo Slydes (non-negotiable)

Create **3 to 5 best-in-class demo Slydes**:

- One luxury property
- One lodge or hotel
- One vehicle
- Optional: one mixed business demo

Each demo must:
- Be mobile perfect
- Show credits clearly
- End with a strong CTA
- Load instantly

These demos do more selling than your homepage.

---

### 3. Finalise onboarding flow
MVP onboarding must:
- Take less than 5 minutes
- Create something real immediately
- Avoid feature explanation overload

Ideal flow:
- Sign up
- Upload first video
- Add one CTA
- Share link

Anything else is friction.

---

## Phase 1: Private beta (Weeks 1 to 2)

### Objectives
- Validate usefulness
- Observe behaviour
- Fix obvious friction

---

### 1. Hand-pick 20 to 30 users
Do NOT open this publicly yet.

Target:
- 10 property or hospitality businesses
- 5 automotive businesses
- 5 to 10 video producers they already work with

These should be people you can talk to directly.

---

### 2. White-glove onboarding
For the first users:
- Help them build their first Slyde
- Offer to set it up with them
- Get their real content live

This is not scalable.
That is fine.

You are learning.

---

### 3. Validate core behaviours
You are looking for answers to these questions:

- Do they share the Slyde instead of a website or PDF?
- Do recipients tap through multiple frames?
- Do producers care about being credited?
- Does the Slyde replace something they were already using?

If the answer to any of these is "no", pause and fix.

---

### 4. Tight feedback loop
After 7 to 10 days:
- Short calls
- Ask what confused them
- Ask what they expected but didn't see
- Ask what they would be annoyed to lose

This defines V1.

---

## Phase 2: Soft public launch (Weeks 3 to 4)

### Objectives
- Controlled exposure
- Early traction
- First inbound

---

### 1. Open signups quietly
Do NOT do a big announcement yet.

Actions:
- Remove invite only
- Keep pricing simple
- Keep expectations clear

Your copy should say:
"This is early. We are focused on a few niches."

That builds trust.

---

### 2. Niche-led outreach (manual)
This is where traction actually comes from.

For each niche:
- Identify 50 to 100 businesses
- Reach out personally
- Share a relevant demo Slyde
- Offer early access

Messages must be niche specific, not generic.

---

### 3. Activate producers as multipliers
Ask video producers to:
- Ask clients to use Slydes
- Request credit on Slydes
- Share their credited work

This creates organic discovery without marketing spend.

---

### 4. Measure the right metrics
Ignore vanity metrics.

Track:
- Slydes created per user
- Slydes shared externally
- Repeat usage within 14 days
- Credits added per Slyde

These tell you if the product sticks.

---

## Phase 3: Public launch (Weeks 5 to 6)

### Objectives
- Clear positioning
- Social proof
- Scalable acquisition

---

### 1. Publish the launch story
This is not a press release.

It should explain:
- The problem with websites and PDFs
- Why mobile presentation matters
- Why Slydes exists
- Who it is for and who it is not

Post it on:
- Your site
- LinkedIn
- Founder networks
- Direct email to early users

---

### 2. Turn users into examples
Feature:
- Real Slydes
- Real businesses
- Real producers

Do NOT use mockups at this stage.

Real usage builds confidence.

---

### 3. Introduce light pricing
Pricing should:
- Be simple
- Be niche aligned
- Not be optimised yet

Early users are validating value, not price sensitivity.

---

### 4. Add referral mechanics (soft)
No complex programmes.

Just:
- "Share your Slyde"
- "Credit your producer"
- "Invite a collaborator"

Let the product spread naturally.

---

## Phase 4: Post-launch optimisation (Weeks 7 to 10)

### Objectives
- Improve retention
- Sharpen positioning
- Prepare V1

---

### 1. Double down on the strongest niche
One niche will outperform the others.

When you see it:
- Update homepage copy
- Lead with that niche
- Build demos for that niche first

Focus beats breadth.

---

### 2. Improve the creation flow
Watch where users stall:
- Upload
- Editing
- CTA selection
- Sharing

Reduce steps.
Remove options.
Speed wins.

---

### 3. Decide what NOT to build
This is critical.

Do not add:
- Music libraries
- Social feeds
- Marketplaces
- Native apps

Unless users explicitly ask and behaviour supports it.

---

## Success criteria for launch

You can call the launch successful if:
- Users replace an existing tool with Slydes
- Businesses keep Slydes live after 30 days
- Producers ask to be credited
- New users arrive via shared links

If this happens, you have product market pull.

---

## One-line launch strategy

**Launch small, prove usefulness, then expand deliberately.**

---

## Final note

This plan is intentionally unsexy.

That is a feature.

Slydes wins by:
- Solving a real problem
- For a specific audience
- In a way that feels obvious once seen

That is how durable products are built.
