# THE CASE FOR SLYDES
## Why Vertical Video is the Future of Business

> **"Built for 2030. Not 2020."**

---

## THE SHIFT

### What Changed

**2015**: Desktop was king. Websites were built horizontal. Scroll down, read left to right, click through menus.

**2025**: 70% of internet traffic is mobile. But businesses are still building websites like it's 2015.

**The disconnect is costing you customers.**

---

## THE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR REVOLUTION

### How People Actually Use Their Phones

- **TikTok**: 1.5 billion users, 52 minutes per day average
- **Instagram Reels**: 200 billion plays per day
- **YouTube Shorts**: 70 billion views per day

**The pattern is clear**: People don't "browse" on mobile anymore. They **scroll**.

### The Psychology

**Vertical video = full attention**
- No distractions (fills entire screen)
- Immersive (feels like the content is talking TO you)
- Effortless (thumb scroll, no clicks, no menus)
- Addictive (dopamine loop, just like social media)

**Traditional websites = fragmented attention**
- Pinch to zoom
- Tiny buttons
- Confusing navigation
- Looks like a desktop site crammed onto a phone

---

## THE BUSINESS PROBLEM

### Your Current Mobile Experience is Broken

You spent $10,000 on a beautiful website. It looks amazing on desktop.

**On mobile?**
- Text is too small
- Images load slowly
- CTAs are hard to tap
- Users leave within 3 seconds

**70% of your traffic** is getting a **terrible experience**.

### You're Competing with TikTok Attention Spans

Your potential customers just spent 45 minutes watching vertical videos.

Then they visit your website and have to:
- Wait for it to load
- Figure out the navigation
- Pinch and zoom
- Click through multiple pages

**They're gone.**

## THE SLYDES SOLUTION

### What if your business could capture attention like TikTok?

**Slydes** is the first platform built entirely for **vertical video storytelling**.

No compromise. No "mobile-responsive" half-measures. **Mobile-FIRST. Mobile-ONLY.**

### How It Works

**For Your Customers**:
1. Open your Slyde link
2. Vertical video fills their screen (just like TikTok)
3. Scroll to see your story unfold
4. Tap to book/contact/buy
5. Share with friends (viral loop)

**For Your Business**:
1. Create stunning video slides
2. Showcase your products/services/spaces
3. Add CTAs (Book Now, Contact, View Menu)
4. Get real-time analytics
5. Update anytime, anywhere

---

## THE THREE PILLARS

### 1. IMMERSION
Full-screen video. No distractions. Your business is the star.

### 2. ENGAGEMENT
Swipe to explore. Every slide tells part of your story. Keep them scrolling.

### 3. CONVERSION
Smart CTAs at every step. Make it stupid-easy to book, buy, or contact.

## THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE

### Why Video Beats Everything

**Text**: 10% retention after 3 days
**Images**: 35% retention after 3 days
**Video**: 95% retention after 3 days

**Video communicates:**
- Emotion (feel the atmosphere)
- Quality (see the craftsmanship)
- Authenticity (real footage, real experiences)
- Trust (transparency builds confidence)

**Vertical video specifically:**
- 9x more completion rate than horizontal video
- 90% higher engagement than traditional content
- Native to how people actually use their phones

---

## THE COMPETITOR PROBLEM

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Instagram Business Profiles**
- Fragmented (users see your post mixed with friends)
- Algorithm-dependent (pay to reach your own followers)
- No booking integration
- Can't control the experience

**Traditional Websites**
- Built for desktop
- "Mobile-responsive" is not mobile-FIRST
- Clunky navigation
- Slow load times

**Yelp / Google Business**
- Dated interface
- Photo-based (not immersive)
- Cluttered with competitor ads
- You don't own the experience

**Slydes is purpose-built for one thing: telling your business story through immersive vertical video.**

---

## THE FUTURE IS VERTICAL

### Where This is Going

Right now, you have a website. People visit it (maybe).

**Tomorrow**: You have a Slyde. People **discover** you through the Slydes app.

**The Vision**:
- Consumer opens Slydes app
- "I need dinner tonight" → Browses restaurant Slydes in their area
- Swipes through options (just like TikTok)
- Books directly in-app
- Shares with friends

**You're not just creating content. You're joining the platform where discovery happens.**

---

## THE NETWORK EFFECT

### Why Early Adopters Win

**Phase 1** (Now - 2025): 
- You get a Slyde link to share
- First-mover advantage in your market
- Stand out from every competitor

**Phase 2** (2025-2026):
- Consumer app launches
- People browse Slydes to discover businesses
- Your business gets discovered organically

**Phase 3** (2026+):
- "Google it" becomes "Slyde it"
- The default way to discover experience-based businesses
- Customers expect you to be on Slydes

**The businesses that join early will dominate their categories when discovery scales.**

---

## THE TRANSFORMATION

### What Changes When You Launch Your Slyde

**Before**:
- Generic website that looks like everyone else
- Mobile experience is an afterthought
- Customers bounce within seconds
- Conversions are low

**After**:
- Immersive video experience that captures attention
- Built for how people actually use their phones
- Customers engage for minutes (not seconds)
- Conversions skyrocket

**This isn't incremental improvement. This is transformation.**

---

## THE CHOICE

### You Have Two Paths

**Path 1: Wait and See**
- Keep your current website
- Watch competitors adopt Slydes
- Lose customers to businesses with better mobile experiences
- Play catch-up in 2027

**Path 2: Lead**
- Adopt Slydes now
- Own your category before competitors wake up
- Give customers the experience they expect
- Win the next decade
