### What We Do NOT Do

- No blocking edits
- No forced upgrade modals
- No "trial ending" messages

Upgrade is contextual, not emotional.

---

## 3. First 30-Day Metrics (Critical)

These metrics decide whether:
- pricing is right
- free limits are correct
- Creator and Pro are compelling

Ignore everything else.

---

### A. Activation Metrics

Track:
- % of signups who publish a Slyde
- Time from signup → first publish

Goal:
Publishing should happen quickly.
If not, pricing doesn't matter yet.

---

### B. Sharing Metrics

Track:
- % of published Slydes that are shared
- Average number of shares per Slyde

Sharing = belief.
No sharing means no perceived value.

---

### C. Free → Creator Conversion Signals

Track:
- % of free users who:
  - try to create a second Slyde
  - click analytics
  - hit media limits
  - try to enable inventory
- Time from first share → upgrade

These moments should naturally cluster around upgrade.

---

### D. Creator → Pro Conversion Signals

Track:
- % of Creator users who:
  - try to enable Buy Now
  - try to enable Cart/Checkout
  - ask about commerce features
- Time from Creator upgrade → Pro upgrade

Commerce need should be obvious.

---

### E. Paid User Behaviour

Track:
- Average number of Slydes per paid user
- Analytics usage frequency
- Commerce activation rate (Pro)
- Retention after first upgrade

If paid users don't actively use analytics, the value prop is wrong.

---

### F. Drop-Off Diagnostics

Track:
- Where users abandon creation
- Where users stop before publishing
- Whether free users stall after first Slyde

These are product problems, not pricing problems.

---

## Metrics to Ignore Early

- Total signups
- Total views
- Vanity conversion rates
- Hypothetical ARPU

Only behaviour matters in the first 30 days.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

Free proves the format.
Creator unlocks growth.
Pro enables commerce.
Metrics decide what comes next.
