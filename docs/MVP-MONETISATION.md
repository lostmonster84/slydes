---

## 2. In-Product Upgrade Prompts

Principle:
Never interrupt creation.
Only prompt when intent is obvious.

---

### Prompt 1: Second Slyde Creation

**Trigger**
User attempts to create a second Slyde.

You can publish one Slyde for free.
Upgrade to Creator to publish up to 10.

CTA:
Upgrade to Creator

---

### Prompt 2: Analytics Access

**Trigger**
User clicks "Analytics" or similar.

**Message**
Analytics are available on the Creator plan.

See how people swipe, where they drop off, and what works.

CTA:
Unlock analytics

Secondary (quiet):
Continue without analytics

---

### Prompt 3: Watermark Awareness (Passive)

**Trigger**
Slyde is live and shared.

**UI Treatment**
Small, unobtrusive note near watermark.

**Copy**
Remove the Slydes watermark with Creator.

(No modal. No urgency.)

---

### Prompt 4: Media Limit Reached

**Trigger**
User hits video or storage limit.

**Message**
This Slyde is growing.
Creator increases your media limits.

CTA:
Upgrade to Creator

---

### What We Do NOT Do

- No countdown timers
- No blocking edits
- No forced upgrade modals
- No "trial ending" messages

Upgrade is contextual, not emotional.

---

## 3. First 30-Day Metrics (Critical)

These metrics decide whether:
- pricing is right
- free limits are correct
- Creator is compelling

Ignore everything else.

---

### A. Activation Metrics

Track:
- % of signups who publish a Slyde
- Time from signup → first publish

Goal:
Publishing should happen quickly.
If not, pricing doesn't matter yet.

---

### B. Sharing Metrics

Track:
- % of published Slydes that are shared
- Average number of shares per Slyde

Sharing = belief.
No sharing means no perceived value.

---

### C. Free → Paid Conversion Signals

Track:
- % of free users who:
  - try to create a second Slyde
  - click analytics
  - hit media limits
- Time from first share → upgrade

These moments should naturally cluster around upgrade.

---

### D. Paid User Behaviour

Track:
- Average number of Slydes per paid user
- Analytics usage frequency
- Retention after first upgrade

If paid users don't actively use analytics, the value prop is wrong.

---

### E. Drop-Off Diagnostics

Track:
- Where users abandon creation
- Where users stop before publishing
- Whether free users stall after first Slyde

These are product problems, not pricing problems.

---

## Metrics to Ignore Early

- Total signups
- Total views
- Vanity conversion rates
- Hypothetical ARPU

Only behaviour matters in the first 30 days.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

Free proves the format.
