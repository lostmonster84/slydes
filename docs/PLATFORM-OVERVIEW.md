- Only launch Consumer App after critical mass (1,000+ businesses)
- Seed initial consumer users with targeted local marketing

### Risk 2: Video Creation Barrier
**Risk**: Businesses may struggle to create quality video content
**Mitigation**:
- Simplified creation tools (templates, one-tap recording)
- Education content (how to film, lighting tips)
- Managed service tier (we create content for premium customers)

### Risk 3: Competitive Response
**Risk**: Instagram, TikTok, or others could copy the concept
**Mitigation**:
- First-mover advantage (lock in early customers)
- Vertical focus (we only serve businesses, not general social)
- Superior UX tailored to business needs
- Network effects create defensibility

### Risk 4: Monetization Timing
**Risk**: Asking businesses to pay too early could stunt growth
**Mitigation**:
- Freemium model in Phase 2 (free tier to attract volume)
