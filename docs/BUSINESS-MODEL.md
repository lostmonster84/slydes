# SLYDES BUSINESS MODEL
## How Money Flows

> **"Build the platform. Capture the value. Scale to dominance."**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Slydes operates as a **two-sided platform** connecting businesses (supply) with consumers (demand).

**Revenue Sources**:
1. **Subscription Revenue** (businesses pay monthly/annually)
2. **Transaction Fees** (commission on bookings facilitated)
3. **Featured Listings** (businesses pay for top placement in discovery)
4. **Enterprise & White Label** (custom solutions for large businesses)

**Economics**:
- High margin (70%+ gross margin targeting)
- SaaS predictability (recurring revenue)
- Network effects (more value = harder to leave)
- Viral growth (share = free acquisition)

---

## REVENUE STREAMS

### STREAM 1: SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE (Primary)

**The Core Model**: Businesses pay monthly or annual subscriptions for access to Slydes platform

---

#### PRICING MODEL: SIMPLIFIED TWO-TIER

**Freemium Model** (Free + Pro only)

| Tier | Price | Features | Target Customer |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 1 Slyde (5 slides max), mandatory Slydes outro branding, no analytics | Testing, early creators |
| **Pro** | $19/mo or $190/yr | Unlimited Slydes, full analytics, lead capture, no branding, custom domain | Most businesses (100%) |

**Annual Discount**: 17% off (2 months free)
- Pro Annual: $190/year (vs $228)

---

#### DISTRIBUTION: INFLUENCER PROGRAM

**Founding Partners** (50 influencers)

| What They Get | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Lifetime Pro Access | Free forever |
| 25% Commission | On every Pro subscriber they refer, for life |
| Early Access | First to use new features |

**Why This Works**:
- Influencers have audience reach we don't
- Commission = aligned incentives (they earn when we earn)
- 25% is generous but sustainable (75% margin on referred customers)
- Distribution > one-time revenue at this stage

See [INFLUENCER-PROGRAM.md](./INFLUENCER-PROGRAM.md) for full details.
---

**Free Tier Strategy**:
- **Purpose**: Low barrier to entry, viral growth
- **Limitation**: Mandatory outro slide ("Built with Slydes") = organic marketing
- **Conversion Goal**: 20-25% upgrade to Pro within 30 days
- **Acceptable**: 75-80% stay free (they're still marketing for us)

---

**Projected MRR (End of 2025)**:

| Tier | Customers | MRR/Customer | Total MRR |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Free | 8,000 | $0 | $0 (viral growth engine) |
| Pro Monthly | 800 | $19 | $15,200 |
| Pro Annual | 1,200 | $15.83 | $19,000 |
| **Total Paid** | **2,000** | — | **$34,200** |

**ARR at End of 2025**: ~$410K

---

### STREAM 2: TRANSACTION FEES (Phase 3+)

**The Model**: Take a small % of bookings facilitated through Slydes Consumer App

---

#### How It Works

1. Consumer discovers restaurant on Slydes app
2. Taps "Reserve Table" CTA
3. **Option A**: Redirects to existing booking system (OpenTable, Resy) — Slydes gets affiliate fee
4. **Option B**: Books directly in Slydes app — Slydes takes 3-5% commission

**Revenue Share Examples**:

| Industry | Avg Transaction | Commission | Slydes Revenue |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------|
| Restaurants | $100 | 5% | $5 |
| Hotels | $500 | 3% | $15 |
| Experiences | $200 | 5% | $10 |
| Car Rentals | $300 | 5% | $15 |
| Services | $150 | 5% | $7.50 |

---

#### Projected Transaction Revenue (2026)

**Assumptions**:
- 5,000 businesses on platform
- Consumer app has 100,000 users
- Average user books 2x/month
- Average transaction value: $200
- Slydes captures 10% of bookings (rest go to existing systems)

**Math**:
- 100,000 users × 2 bookings/month = 200,000 bookings
- 10% via Slydes = 20,000 bookings/month
- 20,000 × $200 × 5% commission = **$200,000/month**
- **$2.4M/year** in transaction revenue

---

**Why This Works**:
- Businesses already pay transaction fees (OpenTable charges 10-15%)
- Slydes is cheaper (3-5%) and brings new customers
- Win-win: business saves money, Slydes earns commission
- Sticky: once booking flow is integrated, businesses won't leave

---

### STREAM 3: FEATURED LISTINGS (Phase 3+)

**The Model**: Businesses pay to appear at top of discovery feed in Consumer App

---

#### How It Works

**Category-Based Featured Spots**:
- User opens Consumer App → "Restaurants Near Me"
- Top 3 results are "Featured" (marked as sponsored)
- Businesses bid or pay fixed fee for placement

**Pricing Models**:

**Option A: Fixed Monthly**
- $299/month for featured placement in your category/location
- Limited spots (max 3 per category per city)

**Option B: CPC (Cost Per Click)**
- Pay $1-$3 per click on your Slyde in feed
- Set daily budget ($50/day = ~17-50 clicks)
- Performance-based (only pay for engagement)

**Option C: CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions)**
- Pay $10-$20 per 1,000 impressions in feed
- Good for brand awareness

---

#### Projected Featured Listings Revenue (2026)

**Assumptions**:
- 50 major cities live in Consumer App
- 10 categories per city (Restaurants, Hotels, etc.)
- 3 featured spots per category
- 30% fill rate initially (businesses opt in)

**Math**:
- 50 cities × 10 categories × 3 spots = 1,500 total featured spots
- 30% fill rate = 450 businesses paying
- 450 × $299/month = **$134,550/month**
- **$1.6M/year** in featured listing revenue

---

### STREAM 4: ENTERPRISE & WHITE LABEL (Phase 2+)

**The Model**: Large businesses, chains, and franchises pay for custom solutions

---

#### Enterprise Tier Features

**For Multi-Location Businesses**:
- Central dashboard (manage all locations)
- Role-based access (corporate vs location managers)
- Branded app (white-label Slydes with their logo)
- Dedicated account manager
- SLA guarantees (99.9% uptime, 24-hour support response)
- Custom integrations (POS, CRM, booking systems)

**Pricing**: $500 - $5,000/month (depends on # locations)

**Example Customers**:
- **Hotel Chain** (50 locations): $2,500/month
- **Restaurant Group** (20 locations): $1,500/month
- **Franchise** (100 locations): $5,000/month

---

#### White Label Solutions

**For Agencies & Resellers**:
- Slydes infrastructure + their branding
- They sell to their clients, keep pricing margin
- We charge wholesale ($50/customer/month)
- They charge retail ($150/customer/month)
- They keep $100/customer as margin

**Revenue**: Wholesale fees + platform usage fees

---

#### Projected Enterprise Revenue (2026)

**Assumptions**:
- 20 enterprise customers (chains, franchises)
- Average contract: $2,000/month

**Math**:
- 20 × $2,000/month = **$40,000/month**
- **$480K/year** in enterprise revenue

**Gross Profit per Customer**: $81/month

**Break-Even Point**:
- $175K / $81 = **2,160 customers**

**With transaction revenue in Phase 3**:
- Gross profit: $129/customer
- Break-even: $175K / $129 = **1,357 customers**
- Much faster path to profitability

---

### Cash Flow Strategy

---

## PRICING STRATEGY

### Why Our Pricing Works

**Positioned Between**:
- **Too Cheap**: Squarespace ($16/mo) — commodity
- **Too Expensive**: Custom dev ($10K-50K) — inaccessible
- **Sweet Spot**: $99-199/mo — affordable but premium

**Value Perception**:
- Traditional website: $5K-$20K upfront + $100/mo hosting
- Slydes: $0 upfront + $99/mo (easier sell)
- ROI: If 1 booking/month from Slyde = $500 revenue → Slydes pays for itself 5x

---

### Pricing Psychology

**Free Tier**:
- **Purpose**: Remove friction, let businesses try risk-free
- **Watermark**: "Powered by Slydes" = organic marketing
- **Upgrade Trigger**: Remove watermark ($99/mo) = vanity upgrade

**Pro Tier ($99)**:
- **Anchor**: Most popular (80% of customers)
- **Perceived Value**: "Unlimited Slydes" sounds huge
- **Reality**: Most use 3-5 Slydes (low cost to serve)

**Premium Tier ($199)**:
- **Signaling**: "I'm a premium brand" (ego play)
- **Features**: White-label, custom domain (status symbols)
- **Margin**: Highest profit (minimal extra cost to deliver)

**Enterprise (Custom)**:
- **Psychology**: "If you have to ask, it's not for you"
- **Qualification**: Only serious, high-value customers inquire
- **Margin**: Highest (negotiated based on value)

---

### Price Increases Over Time

**Strategy**: Grandfather existing customers, raise prices for new signups

**2025**: 
- Free, Pro ($99), Premium ($199)

**2026** (After Consumer App Launch):
- Free, Pro ($129), Premium ($249)
- Existing customers stay at $99/$199
- **Why**: Added value (discovery traffic from Consumer App)

**2027**:
- Free, Pro ($149), Premium ($299)
- **Why**: Network effect = more valuable (harder to leave)

---

## MONETIZATION EXPERIMENTS

### Tests to Run (Phase 2-3)

**Test 1: Annual Prepay Discount**
- Hypothesis: 20% discount → 40% choose annual
- Impact: Upfront cash flow, lower churn

**Test 2: Usage-Based Tiers**
- Hypothesis: "Pay per view" model ($0.01/view)
- Target: Viral businesses (millions of views)

**Test 3: Add-Ons**
- Hypothesis: Charge for extras (video editing, QR codes, premium analytics)
- Impact: Increase ARPU without changing base price

**Test 4: Referral Revenue Share**
- Hypothesis: Give businesses $20 for each referral
- Impact: Lower CAC, viral growth

**Test 5: Freemium Conversion Optimization**

## COMPETITIVE PRICING ANALYSIS

| Competitor | Pricing | Features | Slydes Advantage |
|------------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Squarespace** | $16-$49/mo | Generic website builder | We're video-native, mobile-first |
| **Wix** | $16-$45/mo | Generic website builder | We're vertical video only (better experience) |
| **Linktree** | $0-$9/mo | Simple link-in-bio | We're immersive storytelling (not just links) |
| **OpenTable** | 10-15% commission | Restaurant bookings | We charge less (3-5%) AND bring discovery |
| **Yelp Ads** | $300-$1K/mo | Featured placement | We offer better engagement (video > photos) |
| **Instagram Ads** | Varies | Social ads | We own the experience (not competing in feed) |

## RETENTION & CHURN

### Churn Targets

| Metric | Target | World-Class |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Monthly Churn** | <5% | <2% |
| **Annual Churn** | <40% | <20% |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | >100% | >120% |

**How We Achieve This**:

1. **Product Stickiness**:
   - Analytics (they check it weekly)
   - Link sharing (they promote their Slyde everywhere)
   - Bookings (measurable ROI)

2. **Customer Success**:
   - Onboarding calls (set up for success)
   - Proactive outreach (low engagement = save customer)
   - Content tips (help them create better Slydes)

3. **Network Effect** (Phase 3):
   - Once in Consumer App discovery = can't leave
   - Businesses that leave lose discovery traffic

---

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**Target: >100%**

**How**:
- Start: Customer pays $99/mo (Pro)
- Month 6: Upgrades to Premium ($199/mo) — +101% expansion
- Month 12: Adds transaction revenue ($50/mo) — +25% expansion
- **Year 1 NRR**: 126% (incredible)

Even if 5% churn, expansion revenue offsets it.
