# 1. Slydes – What We Will Never Build

## Purpose
This document defines the hard constraints that protect Slydes from dilution.
It exists to make saying "no" easy and consistent.

If a feature violates this list, it does not ship.

---

## We Will Never Build

### ❌ Traditional multi-page websites
- No page trees
- No navigation menus
- No site maps

Pages are a desktop mental model.
Slydes is a flow.

---

### ❌ A general-purpose CMS
- No blogs
- No long-form content engines
- No SEO optimisation tooling

SEO rewards depth and text.
Slydes rewards momentum and motion.

---

### ❌ Desktop-first experiences
- No designing for desktop and adapting to mobile later
- No complex desktop layouts

Mobile is the product.
Desktop is a preview.

---

### ❌ "Build anything" flexibility
- No blank canvas promises
- No extreme theming
- No hundreds of settings per component

Constraint creates clarity.
Clarity converts.

---

### ❌ Social network mechanics
- No feeds
- No likes
- No comments
- No followers

Slydes is a destination, not a platform competing for attention.

---

### ❌ CRM or marketing automation systems
- No pipelines
- No email campaigns
- No dashboards pretending to be Salesforce

Slydes plugs into stacks.
It does not replace them.

---

### ❌ App builder ambitions
- No native app exports
- No app store strategy

The web is the advantage.
Links win.

---

## One-Sentence Rule

If it slows creation, reduces momentum, or turns Slydes into a website, we do not build it.
