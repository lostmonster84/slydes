# SLYDES | INVESTOR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Slydes is building the TikTok for business discovery.**

70% of internet traffic is mobile — but businesses are still building websites like it's 2015. Meanwhile, consumers spend 52 minutes/day on TikTok. The behavior has shifted. The tools haven't.

**Slydes is the vertical video layer on top of the entire business ecosystem.**

---

## THE PROBLEM

- **Mobile-desktop disconnect**: 70% of traffic is mobile, but most business websites are desktop-first "responsive" afterthoughts
- **Attention has shifted**: TikTok & Reels trained consumers to expect immersive vertical video — traditional websites feel broken
- **Businesses are invisible**: Instagram is for personal use; Google/Yelp are dated and photo-based; there's no platform built for businesses to tell visual stories
- **Discovery is fragmented**: Consumers bounce between 5+ apps to find restaurants, hotels, services — no unified experience layer

---

## THE SOLUTION

**Slydes = Immersive vertical video storefronts for any business**

| Product | What It Does | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Slydes Web** | Marketing, signup, onboarding | Live (MVP) |
| **Partner App** | Mobile-first content creation for businesses | Q2-Q3 2025 |
| **Consumer App** | TikTok-style discovery & booking | Q4 2025 |

**How it works**:
1. Business creates stunning video Slydes (film on phone, publish instantly)
2. Share link anywhere (Instagram bio, QR codes, emails)
3. Consumers discover businesses through the Slydes app (swipe → book → share)
4. Network effect: more businesses = more content = more consumers = more businesses

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

| Competitor | Weakness | Slydes Advantage |
|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Instagram** | Algorithm-dependent, personal-focused | Business-first, you own the experience |
| **Yelp / Google** | Photo-based, dated UX | Video-native, immersive |
| **Squarespace / Wix** | Desktop-first, not video-native | Mobile-only, vertical video built-in |
| **OpenTable** | Single category (restaurants) | All visual businesses, lower fees |
| **TikTok** | Personal content, no commerce focus | Business discovery + booking |

**Defensibility**: Two-sided network effects — as more businesses join, consumer value increases, making it harder to compete.

## WHY NOW?

1. **Behavior shift is permanent** — TikTok trained a generation to expect vertical video
2. **Businesses are desperate** — They know their mobile experience is broken, but have no solution
3. **No one owns this category** — There's no "TikTok for business" yet
4. **Network effects favor first movers** — The platform that wins discovery wins the market
5. **Technology is ready** — Mobile video creation, CDN costs, and smartphone penetration make this viable now

---

## THE VISION (2030)

**Every business that relies on visual storytelling has a Slyde.**

**Every consumer discovers experiences through the Slydes app.**

**"Slyde it" becomes the new "Google it" for finding where to eat, stay, and do.**
