# Slydes Dashboard – v1.3
## Momentum-First Dashboard Design

Status: MVP+  
Purpose: Make progress feel inevitable.

---

## Core Product Belief

The dashboard is not a report.  
It is a feedback loop.

Its job is to:
- show movement
- create confidence
- tell the creator what matters *now*

If a user cannot feel progress within 5 seconds,
the dashboard has failed.

---

## Primary Question the Dashboard Answers

**“Is this getting better, and what should I do next?”**

Everything on the screen exists to support this question.
Nothing else.

---

## Layout Overview (Top → Bottom)

The dashboard is a **single vertical narrative**.

1. Momentum statement
2. One dominant next improvement
3. Ranked Slydes (with direction)
4. Quiet confirmation of progress

No side quests.
No competing panels.

---

## 1. Momentum Header (Hero)

### Purpose
Immediately signal whether progress is happening.

### Content (one sentence only)

Examples (dynamic):
- “Completion is up 6% since your last change.”
- “One Slyde is leaking attention.”
- “CTA clicks increased this week.”
- “No changes shipped yet. Ship one to start momentum.”

### Design Notes
- Large typography
- No cards
- No background
- High contrast
- Calm confidence

This is the emotional anchor of the page.

---

## 2. Primary Focus Card (Dominant Element)

### Section Title
**Next improvement**

(Not “Do this next”. Not “Action centre”.)

### Card Content

**Camping is leaking attention at Frame 3**

Supporting line:
- “42% of viewers leave here.”
- “Last change: 3 days ago.”

Optional suggestion (one line only):
- “Shorten the copy and lead with the payoff.”

Primary Action:
- **Improve this Slyde**

Rules:
- Only one card
- No severity labels
- No dismiss button
- This card visually dominates the page

This card should feel unavoidable.

---

## 3. Slydes List (Ranked by Impact)

### Section Title
**What to improve next**

Subtext:
“Ranked by impact. Open one and ship a fix.”

### Each Slyde Row Shows (only)

- Slyde name
- Completion rate **with direction**
  - ↑ +4%
  - ↓ −2%
  - → no change
- CTA clicks (absolute number)
- Biggest drop-off frame
- Open button

### Example Row

**Camping**
- Completion: 68% ↑ +4%
- CTA clicks: 98
- Drop-off: Frame 3
[Open]

**Just Drive**
- Completion: 61% ↓ −2%
- CTA clicks: 58
- Drop-off: Frame 2
[Open]

### Design Notes
- No tables
- No grid lines
- Soft separation
- Clear vertical rhythm
- Directional arrows are subtle, not gamified

This list should feel alive.

---

## 4. Progress Anchor (Quiet but Powerful)

### Purpose
Confirm that effort compounds.

### Content

One small section, low contrast:

> **Last improvement shipped**  
> Camping – copy shortened on Frame 3 (2 days ago)

Or:

> **This week**  
> 1 Slyde improved · 1 change shipped

Rules:
- No counters
- No streaks
- No badges
- No celebration animations

Recognition without noise.

---

## What This Dashboard Explicitly Does NOT Include

- Inbox or enquiries
- Detailed analytics charts
- Multiple recommendations at once
- “High / Medium / Quick win” labels
- Dismiss actions
- Billing or plan info
- View counts as a primary metric
- Any form of task management

Those live elsewhere or later.

---

## Metric Philosophy (v1.3)

Metrics shown must:
- relate to behaviour
- imply an action
- reflect intent

Allowed:
- Completion rate
- CTA clicks
- Drop-off point
- Directional change

Avoid:
- Vanity totals
- Time-on-page
- Abstract scores
- Over-segmentation

---

## Tone and Language Rules

- Declarative, not suggestive
- Diagnostic, not managerial
- Calm, not hype
- Confident, not apologetic

Example:
- “Camping is leaking attention.”
Not:
- “You might want to consider…”

---

## Visual Design Principles

- One dominant focal point
- Aggressive hierarchy
- Generous whitespace
- Minimal borders
- Typography does the work
- Black-and-white with restraint

Cool comes from subtraction.

---

## Success Criteria

The dashboard is successful if:
- users open a Slyde within seconds
- users return after making a change
- users can describe what’s happening without reading

If users say:
> “I know what to fix.”

It’s working.

---

## One-Line Rule

If the dashboard doesn’t make yesterday feel relevant,
it doesn’t belong in Slydes.
