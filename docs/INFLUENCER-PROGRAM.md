# Slydes Influencer Program (Founding Partners)

> **Goal**: Distribution through aligned incentives. Influencers earn when their audience converts.
>
> **Philosophy**: Give influencers a reason to keep sharing. Commission = ongoing motivation.

---

## Overview

We're selecting **50 influencers and creators** to become **Founding Partners**.

They promote Slydes. They earn commission on every conversion. Simple.

---

## The Deal

| What They Get | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| **Lifetime Creator Access** | Free forever. No monthly fees. |
| **25% Commission** | On every paying subscriber they refer, forever. |
| **Unique Referral Link** | Track all conversions from their audience |
| **Early Access** | First to use new features |
| **Direct Line to James** | Private Slack/Discord channel |
| **Featured Showcase** | Their Slyde featured on slydes.io |

---

## Commission Structure

### How It Works

1. Partner gets unique referral link: `slydes.io/?ref=partnername`
2. Someone signs up through their link
3. When that person upgrades to Creator (£25/mo), partner earns **25% commission**
4. Commission paid monthly via Stripe Connect or PayPal

> See [PAY-TIERS.md](./PAY-TIERS.md) for pricing source of truth and currency conversions.

### The Math

| Scenario | Partner Earnings |
|----------|------------------|
| 10 referrals upgrade to Creator | £62.50/month (£750/year) |
| 50 referrals upgrade to Creator | £312.50/month (£3,750/year) |
| 100 referrals upgrade to Creator | £625/month (£7,500/year) |
| 500 referrals upgrade to Creator | £3,125/month (£37,500/year) |

**25% of £25 = £6.25 per subscriber per month, forever.**

An influencer with 100K followers who converts 0.1% = 100 Creator subscribers = **£625/month passive income**.

---

## Why 25%?

- **Above industry standard**: Most affiliate programs are 10-20%. We're generous.
- **Motivating**: £6.25/subscriber/month adds up fast
- **Sustainable for us**: 75% margin on referred customers is still healthy
- **Forever**: Not a one-time bounty. Ongoing income = ongoing promotion.

---

## What We Get

| Value | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Distribution** | Influencers actively promote (they have skin in the game) |
| **Ongoing Promotion** | Commission = reason to keep mentioning Slydes |
| **Qualified Traffic** | Their audience trusts them, higher conversion rates |
| **Social Proof** | "Used by [Influencer Name]" = instant credibility |
| **Content** | Their Slydes become marketing assets |
