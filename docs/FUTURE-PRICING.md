# Slydes – Future Pricing Tiers (Pro & Agency)

Status: NOT IN MVP
Purpose: Directional clarity only

This document defines the intended future pricing tiers for Slydes.
Nothing in this document ships until behaviour justifies it.

---

## Why Define This Now

Future tiers exist to:
- guide product decisions
- avoid accidental MVP shortcuts
- ensure today's architecture supports tomorrow's customers

This is not a roadmap.
This is a boundary.

---

## Future Tier: Pro

**For serious creators and small teams**

Pro exists for users who:
- rely on Slydes for conversion
- send meaningful traffic
- want deeper insight into behaviour
- iterate based on performance

Pro is not about "more features".
It is about **more leverage**.

---

### Indicative Price
£59 / month

(Annual billing may be added later once retention is proven.)

---

### Intended Includes

- Unlimited published Slydes
- Higher media and traffic limits
- Advanced analytics:
  - drop-off points
  - CTA interactions
  - per-slyde performance
- Multiple drafts and versions
- Priority support
- Early access to new formats and experiments

---

### What Pro Is Not

- Not a team plan
- Not an agency plan
- Not enterprise
- Not seat-based

Pro is still individual-first.

---

## Future Tier: Agency

**For teams managing Slydes at scale**

Agency exists for:
- agencies
- studios
- operators managing multiple brands or clients

This tier only ships once:
- creator behaviour is clear
- Slydes is used repeatedly per client
- agencies are already hacking around limitations

---

### Indicative Price
£149 / month (starting point)

Pricing may scale with:
- usage
- number of workspaces
- traffic
- storage

Seat count alone is not the value driver.

---

### Intended Includes

- Everything in Pro
- Multiple workspaces / clients
- Clear client separation
- Team seats (eg 5 included)
- White-label or reduced Slydes branding
- Higher traffic and media limits
- Agency-friendly workflows

---

### What Agency Is Not

- Not enterprise sales-led
- Not heavily customised
- Not bloated with permissions and roles

Agency should feel powerful, not heavy.

---

## What Must Be True Before Shipping These Tiers

### Pro
- Users actively asking for deeper analytics
- Users publishing multiple Slydes
- Clear correlation between analytics usage and retention

### Agency
- Multiple Slydes per client is common
- Creators managing multiple brands manually
- Willingness to pay is obvious without selling

If these are not true, these tiers do not ship.

---

## Relationship to MVP Pricing

MVP pricing remains:

- Free
- Creator (£25 / month)

Nothing in MVP should:
- depend on Pro or Agency existing
- leak Pro-only features
- create artificial pain to upsell

Upgrades must feel earned, not forced.

---

## One-Line Future Summary

- Creator: build and publish
- Pro: optimise and iterate
- Agency: manage and scale

---

## Final Note

Future pricing exists to support success, not invent it.

If behaviour does not demand these tiers,
they should never be built.
