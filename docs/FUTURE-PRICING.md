## Why Define Future Tiers Now

Future tiers exist to:
- guide product decisions
- avoid accidental MVP shortcuts
- ensure today's architecture supports tomorrow's customers

This is not a roadmap.
This is a boundary.

---

## Future Tier: Agency

**For teams managing Slydes at scale**

Agency exists for:
- agencies
- studios
- operators managing multiple brands or clients

This tier only ships once:
- Creator/Pro behaviour is clear
- Slydes is used repeatedly per client
- Agencies are already hacking around limitations

---

### Indicative Price
£149 / month (starting point)

Pricing may scale with:
- usage
- number of workspaces
- traffic
- storage

Seat count alone is not the value driver.

---

### Intended Includes

- Everything in Pro
- Multiple workspaces / clients
- Clear client separation
- Team seats (e.g., 5 included)
- White-label or reduced Slydes branding
- Higher traffic and media limits
- Agency-friendly workflows

---

### What Agency Is Not

- Not enterprise sales-led
- Not heavily customised
- Not bloated with permissions and roles

Agency should feel powerful, not heavy.

---

## What Must Be True Before Shipping Agency

- Multiple Slydes per client is common
- Creators managing multiple brands manually
- Willingness to pay is obvious without selling

If these are not true, Agency does not ship.

---

## Relationship to Current Pricing

Current pricing:

- Free — try the format
- Creator — analytics + lead generation (£25/mo)
- Pro — full commerce (£50/mo)

Nothing in current tiers should:
- depend on Agency existing
- leak Agency-only features
- create artificial pain to upsell

Upgrades must feel earned, not forced.

---

## One-Line Summary

- Free: try the format
- Creator: analytics + leads
- Pro: commerce + orders
- Agency (future): multi-client at scale

---

## Final Note

Future pricing exists to support success, not invent it.

If behaviour does not demand Agency tier,
it should never be built.
