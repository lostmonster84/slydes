# Practice What We Preach - Slydes.io Website Strategy

> **"If our website isn't engaging, we're not gonna engage."**
>
> **"If our website isn't showing people what they're missing, then WE'RE missing."**
>
> **Critical Truth**: Our website MUST embody everything we sell.

## 🎯 The Core Principle

### We Sell Immersive Mobile Experiences

**Therefore**:

Our own website must BE an immersive experience.

Not just talk about it.
Not just show screenshots.
Not just describe the benefits.

**SHOW IT. LIVE IT. BE IT.**

---

## 🚫 What We DON'T Do

### Traditional SaaS Website Mistakes

**❌ Long scrolling landing page**
- Problem: Boring
- Why: We're selling "kill boring websites"
- If ours is boring, we've already lost

**❌ Feature list with checkmarks**
- Problem: Text-heavy
- Why: We're selling "video-first storytelling"
- If we use text, we're hypocrites

**❌ Static screenshots**
- Problem: Not immersive
- Why: We're selling "immersive experiences"
- If we use stills, we're lying

**❌ Desktop-first layout**
- Problem: Wrong orientation
- Why: We're selling "mobile-native"
- If we're desktop-first, we're frauds

## ✅ What We DO

### Our Website IS a Slyde

**Homepage = A Live Slyde Experience**

```
When you visit slydes.io:

1. You land in FULL-SCREEN immersive mode
2. Vertical scrolling (like a Slyde)
3. Video backgrounds (not static images)
4. Swipeable frames (you experience the product)
5. Mobile-optimized FIRST (desktop is secondary)

You don't READ about Slydes.
You EXPERIENCE a Slyde.
```

## 🎨 Website as Product Demo

### The Homepage IS The Product

**Frame 1: HOOK**
```
Full-screen video background (business using phone)
Headline: "Are you building for 2020 or 2030?"
Subtext: "Your customers are already in 2030."
CTA: "Experience Slydes" (scroll down)
```

**Frame 2: THE PROBLEM**
```
Split-screen video comparison:
Left: Static old website (boring, slow, desktop)
Right: Slyde (immersive, fast, mobile)

Headline: "Old School is OUT. Slydes are IN."
No text. Just visual comparison.
```

**Frame 3: THE SOLUTION**
```
Embedded iPhone mockup showing LIVE Slyde
YOU can swipe through it
YOU experience the difference
Headline: "This is what your customers want."
```

**Frame 4: SOCIAL PROOF**
```
Video testimonials (auto-play, muted, subtitles)
"200+ businesses ditched their old site"
Customer logos (fade in/out)
```

**Frame 5: HOW IT WORKS**
```
3-step animated sequence:
1. Sign up (30 sec animation)
2. Create (5 min time-lapse)
3. Go live (instant transition)

Interactive: "Try building a frame right now" (no signup)
```

**Frame 6: PRICING**
```
Clean, simple cards
$49 / $149 / $499
"Start Free" button (Leader Blue gradient)
Trust signals: No card required, 14-day trial
```

**Frame 7: ACTION**
```
Full-screen CTA
"Ready to build for 2030?"
[Start Free] button
Below: "Join 200+ businesses leading the field"
```

## 📱 Mobile-First Implementation

### Design Principles

**1. Vertical Everything**
- Full viewport height sections
- No horizontal scrolling
- Thumb-friendly tap targets
- Swipe gestures enabled

**2. Video-First**
- Every section has motion
- Auto-play (muted) videos
- Smooth transitions
- Ken Burns effects on stills

**3. Minimal Text**
- Headlines: 10 words max
- Body: 20 words max
- Let visuals do the talking
- CTA clarity over explanation

**4. Fast as Hell**
- < 1 second load time
- Lazy load everything below fold
- Optimized video delivery
- No janky animations

---

## 🎥 Content Strategy

### Video Content Needed

**Hero Video** (15 sec loop):
- Person on phone, scrolling through a Slyde
- Close-up of immersive content
- Swipe gestures visible
- End: Smile, they book something

**Comparison Video** (20 sec):
- Split screen: Old site vs Slyde
- Side-by-side interaction
- Old = slow, boring, text
- Slyde = fast, immersive, video

**Testimonial Videos** (3x 30 sec):
- Real customers (restaurant, hotel, tour)
- Authentic, not scripted
- Format: Problem → Slydes → Result

**Demo Video** (60 sec):
- Screen recording of editor
- Time-lapse: create a Slyde in 60 sec
- Show WYSIWYG positioning
- End with published result

## 🔄 Interaction Design

### Micro-interactions That Matter

**Scroll Behavior**:
- Snap to sections (full-screen frames)
- Parallax backgrounds (subtle)
- Fade in/out animations
- Progress indicator (side dots)

**Button Hovers**:
- Scale up (1.02)
- Gradient shift
- Shadow enhance
- Smooth 200ms transition

**Video Triggers**:
- Auto-play when 50% in viewport
- Mute/unmute toggle
- Loop seamlessly
- Pause when scrolled past

**Form Interactions**:
- Inline validation (instant)
- Success animations
- Error shake (subtle)
- Focus states (Leader Blue ring)

---

## 🎯 Desktop Experience

### Desktop = Bigger Canvas, Same Principles

**Not desktop-first, but desktop-optimized**:

- Still vertical sections (full viewport)
- Wider videos (16:9 instead of 9:16)
- Side-by-side comparisons (split 50/50)
- Larger text (but still minimal)

**Key difference**:
- Desktop: Wide immersive canvas
- Mobile: Tall immersive canvas
- Both: IMMERSIVE

---

## 💪 The Litmus Test

### Before We Launch, Ask

**Questions**:

1. ✅ If someone lands on our site, do they IMMEDIATELY understand what Slydes is?
2. ✅ Do they EXPERIENCE the product, not just read about it?
3. ✅ Is it FASTER than their current site?
4. ✅ Is it MORE ENGAGING than their current site?
5. ✅ Do they think "I want THIS for my business"?

**If ANY answer is NO, we're not ready.**

---

### The Standard

**Our website must be**:
- The BEST example of a Slyde
- The PROOF that our philosophy works
- The DEMONSTRATION of our capability
- The LEADER in our category

**Not just good enough.**

**THE STANDARD.**

---

## 🎉 The Vision

### What Success Looks Like

**A visitor lands on slydes.io**:

1. They're immediately immersed (full-screen video)
2. They scroll through frames (experiencing a Slyde)
3. They think: "Holy shit, this is different"
4. They try the interactive demo
5. They sign up for trial
6. They create their first Slyde
7. They think: "This is exactly what I needed"

**They don't think**:
"Oh, another website builder"

**They think**:
"This is THE FUTURE"

---

## 🔥 The Commitment

### We Practice What We Preach

**Our website**:
- IS a Slyde (not about Slydes)
- IS immersive (not describing immersion)
- IS mobile-first (not mobile-adapted)
- IS the future (not talking about the future)

**We don't say "video-first" and use screenshots.**

**We don't say "immersive" and have a boring landing page.**

**We don't say "built for 2030" and look like 2020.**

**We lead by example.**

**We ARE the standard.**

---

**The Rule**: 

**If we wouldn't recommend this website to a customer, we don't launch it.**

**If we're not proud to show it as THE EXAMPLE, we keep building.**

**If it doesn't make someone say "wow," it's not done.**
