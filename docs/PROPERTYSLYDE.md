## Strategic Analysis: Vertical Video Discovery for Property/Real Estate

> **"Could a Slydes-style platform disrupt Rightmove, Zillow, and the £18B PropTech market?"**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Question**: Can vertical video storytelling transform how people discover and buy property?

**The Answer**: **Yes, but not as a Rightmove replacement.** The opportunity lies in three distinct plays:

1. **Agent Branding Platform** (✅ STRONG) - Help estate agents differentiate through personal video presence
2. **Luxury Discovery Layer** (✅ VIABLE) - TikTok-style browsing for aspirational properties
3. **Full Property Platform** (❌ NOT VIABLE) - Replacing Rightmove head-on is suicide

**Verdict**: PropertySlyde could be a **£50M+ ARR business** focused on agent branding and luxury discovery, NOT a Rightmove killer.

## 1. CURRENT STATE OF PROPERTY SEARCH

### How the Incumbents Work

| Platform | Model | Revenue | UX Pattern |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|
| **Rightmove** (UK) | Listing aggregator | £300M+/year | Grid of static images + specs |
| **Zillow** (US) | Marketplace + Zestimate | $2B+/year | Grid + estimated value |
| **Redfin** (US) | Hybrid brokerage | $1B+/year | Grid + direct agent booking |
| **Zoopla** (UK) | Listing aggregator | £100M+/year | Similar to Rightmove |

### The Standard User Flow

```
1. Set filters (location, price, bedrooms, bathrooms)
2. View grid of properties (hero image + price)
3. Click through to gallery of 10-30 static photos
4. Read description, see floorplan, check map
5. Contact agent or book viewing
```

**This flow is FILTER-FIRST, not DISCOVERY-FIRST.**

### Revenue Model (Rightmove Example)

- Estate agents pay **£1,000-3,000/month** for listings
- Featured listings cost **extra per property**
- Premium placements drive higher visibility
- **No transaction fees** - purely listing/advertising revenue

### Pain Points

**For Buyers:**
- Static images don't tell the story (no sense of flow, light, atmosphere)
- Too much scrolling through identical grids (fatiguing, hard to differentiate)
- Can't FEEL the space (photos are deceptive - wide-angle lenses, staging)
- Discovery is broken (filters limit serendipity)
- Agent friction (multiple agents, inconsistent info, slow responses)

**For Estate Agents:**
- **Commoditization** - Every listing looks the same
- **Price race to bottom** - Buyers shop purely on specs/price
- **No personal brand** - Agents are invisible behind the listing
- **High platform costs** - £2k+/month to Rightmove just to exist
- **Low differentiation** - Premium listings don't feel premium

**For Sellers:**
- Properties blur together in the sea of listings
- Hard to stand out without paying for premium placement
- Emotional value of home not captured in static photos

## 2. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR VISUAL STORYTELLING

### Would Vertical Video Tours Add Value?

| Scenario | Value Proposition | Fit for PropertySlyde? |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Luxury/Aspirational** | Emotional storytelling, lifestyle sell | ✅ STRONG FIT |
| **Vacation rentals** | Experience preview, vibe check | ✅ STRONG FIT |
| **New builds** | Showcase amenities, community feel | ✅ STRONG FIT |
| **Standard listings** | Efficiency over storytelling | ⚠️ WEAK FIT |
| **First-time buyers** | Need specs/data, not just vibes | ⚠️ WEAK FIT |

### Why Vertical Video COULD Work

1. **Attention economy**: People scroll TikTok/Reels for hours - why not property?
2. **Emotional connection**: Video conveys atmosphere, light, flow better than photos
3. **Agent branding**: Estate agents become creators (personality-driven sales)
4. **Discovery layer**: "Show me stunning homes in Scotland" without knowing exact location
5. **Shareability**: "Look at THIS place!" - viral potential for standout properties

### Why Vertical Video Might NOT Work

1. **Property search is high-stakes, not casual** - People need data, not just vibes
2. **Filter-first mindset**: Buyers start with non-negotiables (location, budget, beds)
3. **Time investment**: Watching 20-sec videos for 50 properties = 17 minutes (vs 2-min scroll)
4. **Agent adoption**: Would agents create vertical videos for EVERY listing? (Probably not)

### What Exists Today

| Platform/Trend | What It Is | Success? |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Matterport** | 3D virtual tours (dollhouse view) | ✅ Widely adopted, B2B model |
| **Zillow 3D Home** | Integrated Matterport | ✅ Standard feature now |
| **YouTube walkthroughs** | 5-10 min agent-led tours | ⚠️ Low engagement, boring |
| **TikTok/IG agents** | Vertical video snippets | ✅ Growing, high engagement |
| **Sotheby's films** | Cinematic property content | ✅ Works for £5M+ homes |

**Key Insight**: Matterport dominates "explore every room" (functional). Short-form vertical video is **UNDERSERVED** (agents do it ad-hoc, no platform owns it).

## 3. MARKET ANALYSIS

### TAM/SAM/SOM

| Market | Size | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Global PropTech** | $18B (2024) → $86B (2032) | SaaS, transaction fees, ads |
| **Rightmove** | £300M+ revenue/year | Agent subscriptions, featured listings |
| **Zillow** | $2B+ revenue/year | Premier Agent, mortgage, data |
| **UK Estate Agents** | 70,000 agents | Potential subscribers |
| **US Realtors** | 1.5M agents | Massive scale opportunity |

### The Luxury Segment (Sweet Spot)

| Metric | UK | US |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Luxury sales (£1M+)** | ~15,000/year | ~200,000/year |
| **Luxury agents** | ~5,000 | ~50,000 |
| **Average commission** | 1-2% (£10-20k) | 5-6% ($50-120k) |
| **Willingness to pay for marketing** | HIGH | VERY HIGH |

**The insight**: Luxury agents have **high margins** and **desperate need to differentiate**. They'll pay for video storytelling.

### Revenue Model Comparison

| Model | Revenue Potential | Difficulty |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| **Agent subscriptions** | £50-200/mo × 5,000 agents = £3-12M ARR | MEDIUM |
| **Featured listings** | £100-500/property × 10,000/year = £1-5M ARR | MEDIUM |
| **Affiliate to Rightmove** | £5-20/lead × 100,000/year = £500K-2M ARR | LOW |
| **Full platform replacement** | £100M+ potential, but... | IMPOSSIBLE |

## 4. DISRUPTION POTENTIAL: REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

### Can PropertySlyde Replace Rightmove?

**NO. Here's why:**

| Challenge | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Network effects** | Rightmove has 1M+ properties. Buyers go where listings are. |
| **Agent lock-in** | Agents pay £2k+/month to Rightmove because that's where buyers are |
| **SEO dominance** | "Houses for sale near me" = Rightmove owns page 1 |
| **Marketing budget** | Rightmove spends £100M+/year on brand |
| **Trust** | 20+ years of brand recognition |

**Competing head-on with Rightmove = suicide mission.**

### But You CAN Wedge In...

**Three viable paths:**

---

## 5. THE THREE PLAYS

### PLAY 1: Agent Branding Platform (✅ STRONGEST OPPORTUNITY)

**The Insight**: PropertySlyde isn't for property search - it's for **AGENT BRANDING**.

**How It Works**:
- Estate agents create a personal Slyde showcasing their expertise
- Sections: Featured Listings, Sold Properties, Neighborhood Guides, About Me
- URL: `propertyslyde.io/jane-luxury-homes`
- Use case: Agent sends link to prospects, uses in marketing, stands out

**Example PropertySlyde for an Agent**:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Home** | Agent bio video, credentials, "Meet Jane" |
| **Featured Listings** | 5-10 current properties with vertical tours |
| **Sold** | Past sales (social proof) |
| **Neighborhoods** | "Living in Edinburgh" guide videos |
| **Testimonials** | Client review videos |

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Agents are DESPERATE to differentiate (everyone looks the same on Rightmove)
- ✅ Personal branding is critical in real estate (trust-driven industry)
- ✅ Doesn't compete with Rightmove (agents use BOTH)
- ✅ Low barrier to entry (1 agent can start, no network effects needed)
- ✅ Scalable (millions of agents globally)

**Revenue Model**:

| Tier | Price | Slydes | Target |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Free** | £0 | 1 | Trial agents |
| **Creator** | £50/mo | 10 | Solo agents |
| **Pro** | £100/mo | 25 | Team leads |
| **Agency** | £200/mo | 75 | Full agencies |

**TAM for Agent Branding**:
- **UK**: 70,000 agents × £75/mo avg = £63M ARR potential
- **US**: 1.5M Realtors × $100/mo avg = $1.8B ARR potential
- **Realistic capture (5%)**: £3M UK + $90M US = **£75M+ ARR**

---

### PLAY 2: Luxury Discovery Layer (✅ VIABLE)

**The Insight**: TikTok-style browsing for aspirational properties.

**How It Works**:
- Consumer-facing app: Swipe through stunning luxury properties
- Location + price filters, but discovery-first UX
- CTA: "Interested? Contact agent" or "View full listing on Rightmove"
- Revenue: Agent subscriptions for featured Slydes + affiliate referrals

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Luxury buyers browse aspirationally ("What speaks to me?")
- ✅ Discovery fits the mindset (not filter-first)
- ✅ Shareability: "Look at this £5M Scottish castle!"
- ✅ Agents get a marketing channel (not replacement)

**Why It's Challenging**:
- ⚠️ Niche market (limits scale beyond luxury)
- ⚠️ Incomplete solution (still need Rightmove for serious search)
- ⚠️ Agent adoption requires proving ROI

**TAM for Luxury Discovery**:
- 5,000 UK luxury agents × £100/mo = £6M ARR
- 50,000 US luxury agents × $150/mo = $90M ARR
- **Total luxury opportunity: ~£75M ARR**

---

### PLAY 3: Full Property Platform (❌ NOT VIABLE)

**The Insight**: Trying to replace Rightmove is a death wish.

**What It Would Require**:
- Critical mass of listings (need 100,000+ to be useful)
- Agent migration (why would they switch?)
- Consumer trust (Rightmove = default, you = unknown)
- £100M+ funding to compete on marketing
- Years of SEO investment

**Why It Won't Work**:
- ❌ Rightmove network effects are unbeatable
- ❌ Agents won't switch without buyers
- ❌ Buyers won't switch without listings
- ❌ Vertical video alone isn't enough to justify platform switch
- ❌ You'd need to be 10x better, and that's impossible in listing aggregation

**Verdict**: Don't even try.

---

## 6. RECOMMENDED APPROACH

### If Slydes Pursued Property...

**Year 1: Agent Branding Focus**

1. **Target**: Luxury estate agents in London, Edinburgh, Manchester
2. **Product**: Personal Slyde for agent branding (not property search)
3. **Pricing**: £50-100/mo subscription
4. **GTM**: Direct sales to top agencies, LinkedIn outreach
5. **Goal**: 500 paying agents = £400K ARR

**Year 2: Expand + Add Discovery**

1. **Expand**: Mid-market agents who want differentiation
2. **Add**: Consumer discovery app for luxury properties
3. **Revenue**: Agent subs + featured listings + affiliate
4. **Goal**: 2,000 agents + 50,000 app users = £2M ARR

**Year 3: Scale or Spin Out**

1. **If working**: Raise funding, scale to US market
2. **If struggling**: Keep as use case within Slydes platform
3. **Goal**: £10M+ ARR or fold back into core Slydes

---

## 7. THE VERDICT

### Is PropertySlyde a Real Opportunity?

**YES - But as Agent Branding + Luxury Discovery, NOT Rightmove Replacement.**

| Opportunity | Viability | TAM | Recommendation |
|-------------|-----------|-----|----------------|
| **Agent Branding Platform** | ✅ HIGH | £75M+ ARR | PURSUE |
| **Luxury Discovery Layer** | ✅ MEDIUM | £75M ARR | PURSUE (Phase 2) |
| **Full Property Platform** | ❌ LOW | N/A | AVOID |

### Key Success Factors

1. **Don't compete with Rightmove** - Be complementary
2. **Start with agents, not buyers** - No chicken-and-egg problem
3. **Focus on luxury first** - Higher margins, willing to pay
4. **Video quality matters** - Bad video = worse than no video
5. **Prove ROI** - Agents need to see leads/sales from PropertySlyde

### Financial Projections (If Pursued)

| Year | Agents | ARR | Notes |
|------|--------|-----|-------|
| **Year 1** | 500 | £500K | UK luxury agents only |
| **Year 2** | 2,000 | £2M | + discovery app |
| **Year 3** | 10,000 | £10M | UK + US expansion |
| **Year 5** | 50,000 | £50M | Global luxury agents |

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

**PropertySlyde is a legitimate £50M+ ARR opportunity** - but only if positioned correctly.

**What it IS**:
- A personal branding platform for estate agents
- A discovery layer for luxury property browsing
- A marketing channel that complements Rightmove

**What it is NOT**:
- A Rightmove replacement
- A full property search platform
- A mass-market solution

**The play**: Help agents stand out, not replace where listings live.

**Should Slydes pursue this?**
- Not now. Focus on core experience-based businesses first.
- Revisit when Slydes is at £5M+ ARR and looking to expand.
- If pursued, spin out as separate product with dedicated team.
